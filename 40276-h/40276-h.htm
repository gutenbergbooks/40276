<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>This little book closes a series of five volumes which I
undertook some years since, in the wish to teach boys
and girls how to use for themselves the treasures which
they have close at hand in the Public Libraries now so
generally opened in the Northern States of America. The
librarians of these institutions are, without an exception,
so far as I know, eager to introduce to the young the
books at their command. From these gentlemen and
ladies I have received many suggestions as the series went
forward, and I could name many of them who could have
edited or prepared such a series far more completely
than I have done. But it is not fair to expect them, in
the rush of daily duty, to stop and tell boys or girls what
will be "nice books" for them to read. If they issue
frequent bulletins of information in this direction, as is
done so admirably by the librarians at Providence and at
Hartford, they do more than any one has a right to ask
them for. Such bulletins must be confined principally to
helping young people read about the current events of the
day. In that case it will only be indirectly that they send
the young readers back into older literature, and make
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>them acquainted with the best work of earlier times.</p>

<p>I remember well a legend of the old Public Library at
Dorchester, which describes the messages sent to the hard-pressed
librarian from the outlying parts of the town on
the afternoon of Saturday, which was the only time when
the Library was open.</p>

<p>"Mother wants a sermon book and another book."
This was the call almost regularly made by the messengers.</p>

<p>I think that many of the most accomplished librarians
of to-day have demands not very dissimilar, and that they
will be glad of any assistance that will give to either
mother or messenger any hint as to what this "other
book" shall be.</p>

<p>It is indeed, of course, almost the first thing to be
asked that boys and girls shall learn to find out for themselves
what they want, and to rummage in catalogues,
indexes, and encyclop&aelig;dias for the books which will best
answer their necessities. Mr. Emerson's rule is, "Read in
the line of your genius." And the young man or maiden
who can find out, in early life, what the line of his or her
genius is, has every reason to be grateful to the teacher, or
the event, or the book that has discovered it. I have
certainly hoped, in reading and writing for this series, that
there might be others of my young friends as sensible and
as bright as Fergus and Fanchon, who will be found to
work out their own salvation in these matters, and order
their own books without troubling too much that nice
Miss Panizzi or that omniscient Mrs. Bodley who manages
the Library so well, and knows so well what every one in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>the town has read, and what he has not read.</p>

<p>I had at first proposed to publish with each book a
little bibliography on the subjects referred to, telling particularly
where were the available editions and the prices
at which they could be bought by young collectors. But
a little experiment showed that no such supplement could
be made, which should be of real use for most readers for
whom these books are made. The same list might be
too full for those who have only small libraries at command,
and too brief for those who are fortunate enough
to use large ones. Indeed, I should like to say to such
young readers of mine as have the pluck and the sense to
read a preface, that the sooner they find out how to use
the received guides in such matters,&mdash;the very indexes
and bibliographies which I should use in making such a
list for them,&mdash;why, the better will it be for them.</p>

<p>Such books as Poole's Index, Watt's and Brunet's
Bibliographies, and the New American Indexes, prepared
with such care by the Librarians' Association, are at hand
in almost all the Public Libraries; and the librarians will
always be glad to encourage intelligent readers in the use
of them.</p>

<p>I should be sorry, in closing the series, not to bear my
testimony to the value of the Public Library system, still
so new to us, in raising the standard of thought and education.
For thirty years I have had more or less to do
with classes of intelligent young people who have met for
study. I can say, therefore, that the habit of thought
and the habit of work of such young people now is different
from what it was thirty years ago. Of course it ought
to be. You can say to a young learner now, "This book<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
says thus and so, but you must learn for yourself whether
this author is prejudiced or ill-informed, or not."</p>

<p>You can send him to the proper authorities. On almost
any detail in general history, if he live near one of
the metropolitan libraries, you can say to him, "If you
choose to study a fortnight on this thing, you will very
likely know more about it than does any person in the
world." It is encouraging to young people to know that
they can thus take literature and history at first hand. It
pleases them to know that "the book" is not absolute.
With such resources that has resulted which such far-seeing
men as Edward Everett and George Ticknor and Charles
Coffin Jewett hoped for,&mdash;the growth, namely, of a race
of students who do not take anything on trust. As Professor
Agassiz was forever driving up his pupils to habits of
original observation in natural history, the Public Library
provokes and allures young students to like courage in
original research in matters of history and literature.</p>

<h1>STORIES OF INVENTION<br /><br />

<small>TOLD BY INVENTORS.</small></h1>



<hr  />
<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>I.<br /><br />

<small>INTRODUCTION.</small></h2>


<p>There is, or is supposed to be, somewhere in Norfolk
County in Massachusetts, in the neighborhood
of the city of Boston, a rambling old house which in its
day belonged to the Oliver family. I am afraid they
were most of them sad Tories in their time; and I am not
sure but these very windows could tell the story of one or
another brick-bat thrown through them, as one or another
committee of the people requested one or another Oliver,
of the old times, to resign one or another royal commission.
But a very peaceful Rowland has taken the place
of those rebellious old Olivers.</p>

<p>This comfortable old house is now known to many
young people as the home of a somewhat garrulous old
gentleman whom they call Uncle Fritz. His real name
is Frederick Ingham. He has had a checkered life,
but it has evidently been a happy one. Once he was in
the regular United States Navy. For a long time he was
a preacher in the Sandemanian connection, where they
have no ordained ministers. In Garibaldi's time he was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
colonel in the patriot service in Italy. In our civil war
he held a command in the national volunteer navy;
and his scientific skill and passion for adventure called
him at one time across "the Great American Desert,"
and at another time across Siberia, in the business of constructing
telegraphs. In point of fact, he is not the relation
of any one of the five-and-twenty young people who
call him Uncle Fritz. But he pets them, and they pet
him. They like to make him a regular visit once a week,
as the winter goes by. And the habit has grown up, of
their reading with him, quite regularly, on some subject
selected at their first meeting after they return from the
country. Either at Lady Oliver's house, as his winter
home is called, or at Little Crastis, where he spends his
summers, those selections for reading have been made,
which have been published in a form similar to that of the
book which the reader holds in his hand.</p>

<p>The reader may or may not have seen these books,&mdash;so
much the worse for him if he have not,&mdash;but that omission
of his may be easily repaired. There are four of
them: <span class="smcap">Stories of War</span> told by Soldiers; <span class="smcap">Stories of the
Sea</span> told by Sailors; <span class="smcap">Stories of Adventure</span> told by Adventurers;
<span class="smcap">Stories of Discovery</span> told by Discoverers.</p>

<p>Since the regular meetings began, of which these books
are the history, the circle of visitors has changed more or
less, as most circles will, in five years. Some of those
who met are now in another world. Some of the boys
have grown to be so much like men, that they are "subduing
the world," as Uncle Fritz would say, in their several
places, and that they write home, from other latitudes and
longitudes, of the Discoveries and Adventures in which
they have themselves been leaders. But younger sisters
and brothers take the places of older brothers and sisters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
The club&mdash;for it really is one&mdash;is popular, Lady Oliver's
house is large, and Uncle Fritz is hospitable. He says
himself that there is always room for more; and Ellen
Flaherty, or whoever else is the reigning queen in the
kitchen, never complains that the demand is too great for
her "waffles."</p>

<p>Last fall, when the young people made their first appearance,
the week before Thanksgiving day, after the
new-comers had been presented to Uncle Fritz, and a
chair or two had been brought in from the dining-room
to make provision for the extra number of guests, it
proved that, on the way out, John Coram, who is Tom
Coram's nephew, had been talking with Helen, who is one
of the old Boston Champernoons, about the change of
Boston since his uncle's early days.</p>

<p>"I told her," said he to Uncle Fritz, "that Mr. Allerton
was called 'the last of the merchants,' and he is dead
now."</p>

<p>"That was a pet phrase of his," said Uncle Fritz.
"He meant that his house, with its immense resources,
simply bought and sold. He was away for many years
once. When he returned, he found that the chief of his
affairs had made an investment, from motives of public
spirit, in a Western railroad. 'I thought we were merchants,'
said the fine old man, disapproving. As he
turned over page after page of the account, he found at
last that the whole investment had been lost. 'I am
glad of that,' said he; 'you will remember now that we
are merchants.'"</p>

<p>"But surely my father is a merchant," said Julius.
"He calls himself a merchant, he is put down as a
merchant in the Directory, and he buys and sells, if
that makes a man a merchant."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>"All that is true," said Uncle Fritz. "But your father
also invests money in railroads; so far he is engaged in
transportation. He is a stockholder and a director in
the Hecla Woollen Mills at Bromwich; so far he is a
manufacturer. He told me, the other day, that he had
been encouraging my little friend Griffiths, who is experimenting
in the conservation of electric power; so far he
is an inventor, or a patron of inventions.</p>

<p>"In substance, what Mr. Allerton meant when he said
'I thought we were merchants,' was this: he meant that
that firm simply bought from people who wished to sell,
and sold to people who wished to buy.</p>

<p>"The fact, that almost every man of enterprise in Massachusetts
is now to a certain extent a manufacturer,
shows that a great change has come over people here
since the beginning of this century."</p>

<p>"Those were the days of Mr. Cleveland's adventures,
and Mr. Forbes's," said Hugh.</p>

<p>He alluded to the trade in the Pacific, in which these
gentlemen shared, as may be read in <span class="smcap">Stories of Adventure</span>.</p>

<p>Uncle Fritz said, "Yes." He said that the patient love
of Great Britain for her colonies forbade us here from making
so much as a hat or a hob-nail while we were colonies,
as it would gladly do again now. He said that the New
Englanders had a great deal of adventurous old Norse
blood in their veins, that they had plenty of ship-timber
and tar. If they could not make hob-nails they could
make ships; and they made very good ships before they
had been in New England ten years.</p>

<p>Luckily for us, soon after the country became a country,
near a hundred years ago, the quarrels of Europe were
such, that if an English ship carried produce of the West<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Indies or China to Europe, France seized, if she could,
ship and cargo; if a French ship carried them, English
cruisers seized ship and cargo, if they could. So it happened
that the American ships and the American sailors,
who were not at war with England and were not at war
with France, were able to carry the stores which were
wanted by all the world. The wars of Napoleon were
thus a steady bounty for the benefit of the commerce of
America. When they were well over, we had become so
well trained to commerce here, that we could build the
best ships in the world; and we thought we had the best
seamen in the world,&mdash;certainly there were no better.
Under such a stimulus, and what followed it, our commerce,
as measured by the tonnage of our ships, was as
large as that of any nation, and, if measured by the miles
sailed, was probably larger.</p>

<p>All this prosperity to merchants was broken up by the
War of 1812, between the United States and Great Britain.
For two years and a half, then, our intercourse with
Europe was almost cut off; for the English cruisers now
captured our vessels whenever they could find them. At
last we had to make our own hob-nails, our guns, our cannon,
our cotton cloth, and our woollen cloth, if we meant
to have any at all. The farmers' wives and daughters had
always had the traditions of spinning and weaving.</p>

<p>When Colonel Ingham said this, Blanche nodded to
Mary and Mary to Blanche.</p>

<p>"That means," said the Colonel, "that you have brought
dear old mother Tucker's spinning-wheel downstairs, and
have it in the corner behind your piano, does it not?"</p>

<p>Blanche laughed, and said that was just what she meant.</p>

<p>"It does very well in 'Martha,'" said the Colonel.
"And can you spin, Blanche?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Blanche rather surprised him by saying that she could,
and the Colonel went on with his lecture. Fergus, who
is very proud of Blanche, slipped out of the room, but
was back after a minute, and no one missed him.</p>

<p>Here in Massachusetts some of the most skilful merchants&mdash;Appletons,
Perkinses, and Lawrences&mdash;joined
hand with brave inventors like Slater and Treadwell, and
sent out to England for skilful manufacturers like Crompton
and Boott; thus there sprung up the gigantic system
of manufacture, which seems to you children a thing of
course. Oddly enough, the Southern States, which had
always hated New England and New England commerce,
and had done their best to destroy it when they had a
chance, were very eager to secure a home-market for
Southern cotton; and thus, for many years after the war,
they kept up such high protective duties that foreign goods
were very dear in America, and the New England manufacturers
had all the better prices.</p>

<p>While Uncle Fritz was saying this in substance, Ransom,
the old servant, appeared with a spinning-wheel from
Colonel Ingham's music-room. The children had had it
for some charades. Kate Fogarty, the seamstress of the
Colonel's household, followed, laughing, with a great hank
of flax; and when the Colonel stopped at the interruption,
Fergus said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I thought, Uncle Fritz, they would all like to see how
well Blanche spins; so I asked Ransom to bring in the
wheel."</p>

<p>And Blanche sat down without any coaxing, and made
her wheel fly very prettily, and spun her linen thread as
well as her great-grandmamma would have done. Colonel
Ingham was delighted; and so were all the children, half
of whom had never seen any hand-spinning before. All of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
them had seen cotton and wool spun in factories; in fact,
half of them had eaten their daily bread that day, from the
profit of the factories that for ten hours of every day do
such spinning.</p>

<p>"Now, you see," said the well-pleased Colonel,
"Blanche spins that flax exactly as her grandmother
nine generations back spun it. She spins it exactly as
Mrs. Dudley spun it in the old house where Dr. Paterson's
church stands. It is strange enough, but for one
hundred and fifty years there seems to have been no
passion for invention among the New Englanders. Now
they are called a most <i>inventive</i> people, and that bad
word has been coined for them and such as they.</p>

<p>"But all this is of the last century. It was as soon as
they were thrown on their own resources that they began
to invent. Eli Whitney, a Worcester County boy, graduated
at Yale College in 1791. He went to Georgia at
once, to be a tutor in a planter's family; but before he
arrived, the planter had another tutor. This was a fortunate
chance for the world; for poor Whitney, disappointed,
went to spend the winter at the house of Mrs.
General Greene. One day, at dinner, some guests of hers
said that cotton could never be exported with profit
unless a machine could be made to separate the seeds
from the 'wool.' 'If you want anything invented,' said
Mrs. Greene, 'ask my young friend Mr. Whitney; he
will invent anything for you.' Whitney had then never
seen cotton unmanufactured. But he went to work; and
before he was one year out of college, he had invented
the cotton-gin, which created an enormous product of
cotton, and, in fact, changed the direction of the commerce
of the world.</p>

<p>"Well, you know about other inventions. Robert<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
Fulton, who built the first effective steamboat, was
born in Pennsylvania the same year Whitney was born
in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>"Hector, you are fond of imaginary conversations:
write one in which Whitney and Fulton meet, when each
is twenty-one; let Daniel Boone look in on them, and
prophesy to them the future of the country, and how
much it is to owe to them and to theirs."</p>

<p>"I think Blanche had better write it&mdash;in a ballad," said
Hector, laughing. "It shall be an old crone spinning;
and as she turns her wheel she shall describe the &AElig;tna
Factory at Watertown."</p>

<p>"There shall be a <i>refrain</i>," said Wallace,&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"'Turn my wheel gayly;<br />
Spin, flax, spin.'"<br />
</p>

<p>"No," said Hatty; "the refrain shall be</p>

<p class="poem">
'Four per cent in six months,<br />
Eight per cent in twelve.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">We are to go to Europe if the Vesuvius Mills pay a
dividend. But if they <i>pass</i>, I believe I am to scrub
floors in my vacation."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Uncle Fritz, recalling them to the
subject they had started on. "All this is enough to show
you how it is that you, who are all New Englanders, are
no longer seafaring boys or girls, exclusively or even
principally. Your great-grandmother, Alice, saved the
lives of all the crew of a Bristol trader, by going out in
her father's boat and taking her through the crooked
passage between the Brewsters. You would be glad to
do it, but I am afraid you cannot."</p>

<p>"I should rather encourage those who go to do it,"
said Alice, demurely, repeating one of their familiar jokes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"And your great-grandfather, Seth, is the Hunt who
discovered Hunt's Reef in the Philippines. I am afraid
you cannot place it on the map."</p>

<p>"I know I cannot," said Seth, bravely.</p>

<p>"No," said the old gentleman. "But all the same the
reef is there. I came to an anchor in the 'Calypso,' waiting
for a southwest wind, in sight of the breakers over it.
And I wish we had the pineapples the black people sold
us there.</p>

<p>"All the same the New Englanders are good for something.
Ten years hence, you boys will be doing what your
fathers are doing,&mdash;subduing the world, and making it
to be more what God wants it to be. And you will not
work at arms' length, as they did, nor with your own
muscles."</p>

<p>"We have Aladdin's lamp," said Mary, laughing.</p>

<p>"And his ring," said Susie. "I always liked the ring
one better than the lamp one, though he was not so
strong."</p>

<p>"He is prettier in the pictures," said George.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Colonel; "we have stronger Genii than
Aladdin had, and better machinery than Prince Camaralzaman."</p>

<p>"I heard some one say that Mr. Corliss had added
twenty-seven per cent to the working power of the world
by his <i>cut-off</i>," said Fergus.</p>

<p>The Colonel said he believed that was true. And this
was a good illustration of what one persevering and intelligent
man can do in bringing in the larger life and
nobler purpose of the Kingdom of Heaven. Such a
man makes men cease from <i>labor</i>, which is always irksome,
and <i>work</i> with God. This is always ennobling.</p>

<p>"I am ashamed to say that I do not know what a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
<i>cut-off</i> is," said Alice, who, like Seth, had been trained to
"confess ignorance."</p>

<p>"I was going to say so," said John Rodman.</p>

<p>"And I,&mdash;and I,&mdash;and I," said quite a little chorus.</p>

<p>"We must make up a party, the first pleasant day,
and go and see the stationary engine which pumps this
water for us." So the Colonel met their confessions.</p>

<p>"But does not all this indicate that we might spend a few
days in looking up inventions?"</p>

<p>"I think we ought to," said Hatty. "Certainly we
ought, if the Vesuvius pays. Imagine me at Manchester.
Imagine John Bright taking me through his own mill, and
saying to me, 'This is the rover we like best, on the whole.
Do you use this in America?' Imagine me forced to
reply that I do not know a rover when I see one, and
could not tell a 'slubber' from a 'picker.'"</p>

<p>The others laughed, and confessed equal ignorance.
"Only, John Bright has no mills in Manchester, Hatty."</p>

<p>"Well, they are somewhere; and I must not eat the
bread of the Vesuvius slubbers, and not know something
of the way in which slubbers came to be."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Uncle Fritz, as usual recalling the conversation
to sanity. "Whom shall we read about first?"</p>

<p>"Tubal Cain first," said Fergus. "He seems to have
been the first of the crew."</p>

<p>"It was not he who found out witty inventions," said
Fanchon, in a mock <i>aside</i>.</p>

<p>"I should begin with Archimedes," said Uncle Fritz.</p>

<p>"Excellent!" said Fergus; "and then may we not burn
up old Fogarty's barn with burning-glasses?"</p>

<p>The children dislike Fogarty, and his barn is an eyesore
to them. It stands just beyond the hedge of the
Lady Oliver garden.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"I thank Archimedes every time I take a warm bath.
Did he not invent hot baths?"</p>

<p>"What nonsense! He was killed by Caligula in one."</p>

<p>"You shall not talk such stuff.&mdash;Uncle Fritz, what
books shall I bring you?"</p>

<p>It would seem as if, perhaps, Uncle Fritz had led the
conversation in the direction it had taken. At least it
proved that, all together on the rolling book-rack which
Mr. Perkins gave him, were the account of Archimedes in
the Cyclop&aelig;dia Britannica, the account in the French
Universal Biography, the life in La Rousse's Cyclop&aelig;dia,
Plutarch's Lives, and a volume of Livy in the Latin.
From these together, Uncle Fritz, and the boys and girls
whom he selected, made out this little history of
Archimedes.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II.<br /><br />

<small>ARCHIMEDES.</small></h2>


<p>Archimedes was born in Syracuse in the year
287 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, and was killed there in the year 212 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>
He is said to have been a relation of Hiero, King of
Syracuse; but he seems to have held no formal office
known to the politicians. Like many other such men,
however, from his time down to Ericsson, he came to the
front when he was needed, and served Syracuse better
than her speech-makers. While he was yet a young man,
he went to Alexandria to study; and he was there the
pupil of Euclid, the same Euclid whose Geometry is the
basis of all the geometry of to-day.</p>

<p>While Archimedes is distinctly called, on very high
authority, "the first mathematician of antiquity," and
while we have nine books which are attributed to him,
we do not have&mdash;and this is a great misfortune&mdash;any
ancient biography of him. He lived seventy-five years,
for most of that time probably in Syracuse itself; and it
would be hard to say how much Syracuse owed to his
science. At the end of his life he saved Syracuse from
the Romans for three years, during a siege in which, by
his ingenuity, he kept back Marcellus and his army. At
the end of this siege he was killed by a Roman soldier
when the Romans entered the city.</p>

<p>The books of his which we have are on the "Sphere
and Cylinder," "The Measure of the Circle," "Conoids<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
and Spheroids," "On Spirals," "Equiponderants and Centres
of Gravity," "The Quadrature of the Parabola," "On
Bodies floating in Liquids," "The Psammites," and "A
Collection of Lemmas." The books which are lost are
"On the Crown of Hiero;" "Cochleon, or Water-Screw;"
"Helicon, or Endless Screw;" "Trispaston, or
Combination of Wheels and Axles;" "Machines employed
at the Siege of Syracuse;" "Burning Mirror;"
"Machines moved by Air and Water;" and "Material
Sphere."</p>

<p>As to the story of the bath-tub, Uncle Fritz gave to
Hector to read the account as abridged in the "Cyclop&aelig;dia
Britannica."</p>

<p>"Hiero had set him to discover whether or not the gold
which he had given to an artist to work into a crown for
him had been mixed with a baser metal. Archimedes was
puzzled by the problem, till one day, as he was stepping
into a bath, and observed the water running over, it occurred
to him that the excess of bulk occasioned by the
introduction of alloy could be measured by putting the
crown and an equal weight of gold separately into a vessel
filled with water, and observing the difference of overflow.
He was so overjoyed when this happy thought struck him
that he ran home without his clothes, shouting, 'I have
found it, I have found it,'&mdash;&#917;&#8021;&#961;&#951;&#954;&#945;, &#917;&#8021;&#961;&#951;&#954;&#945;.</p>



<p>"This word has been chosen by the State of California
for its motto."</p>

<p>To make the story out, it must be supposed that the
crown was irregular in shape, and that the precise object
was to find how much metal, in measurement, was
used in its manufacture. Suppose three cubic inches of
gold were used, Archimedes knew how much this would
cost. But if three cubic inches of alloy were used, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
king had been cheated. What the overflow of the water
taught was the precise cubic size of the various ornaments
of the crown. A silver crown or a lead crown would displace
as much water as a gold crown of the same shape
and ornament. But neither silver nor lead would weigh
so much as if pure gold were used, and at that time
pure gold was by far the heaviest metal known.</p>

<p>Fergus, who is perhaps our best mathematician, pricked
up his ears when he heard there was a treatise on the
relation of the Circle to the Square. Like most of the
intelligent boys who will read this book, Fergus had tried
his hand on the fascinating problem which deals with that
proportion. Younger readers will remember that it is
treated in "Swiss Family." Jack&mdash;or is it perhaps Ernest?&mdash;remembers
there, that for the ribbon which was
to go round a hat the hat-maker allowed three times the
diameter of the hat, and a little more. This "little more"
is the delicate fraction over which Archimedes studied;
and Fergus, after him. Fergus knew the proportion as
far as thirty-three figures in decimals. These are 3.141,592,653,589,793,238,462,643,383,279,502.
When Uncle
Fritz asked Fergus to repeat these, the boy did it promptly,
somewhat to the astonishment of the others. He had
committed it to memory by one of Mr. Gouraud's "analogies,"
which are always convenient for persons who have
mathematical formulas to remember.</p>

<p>When those of the young people who were interested in
mathematics looked at Archimedes's solution of the problem,
they found it was the same as that they had themselves
tried at school. But he carried it so far as to inscribe a
circle between two polygons, each of ninety-six sides; and
his calculation is based on the relation between the two.</p>

<p>Taking the "Swiss Family Robinson" statement again,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Archimedes shows that the circumference of a circle exceeds
three times its diameter by a small fraction, which
is less than 10/70 and greater than 10/71 and that a circle is to
its circumscribing square nearly as 11 to 14. Those who
wish to carry his calculations farther may be pleased to
know that he found the figures 7 to 22 expressed the relation
more correctly than 1 to 3 does. Metius, another
ancient mathematician, used the proportion 113 to 355.
If you reduce that to decimals, you will find it correct to
the sixth decimal. Remember that Archimedes and Metius
had not the convenience of the Arabic or decimal notation.
Imagine yourselves doing Metius's sum in division
when you have to divide CCCLV by CXIII. Archimedes,
in fact, used the Greek notation,&mdash;which was a little better
than the Roman, but had none of the facility of ours.
For every <i>ten</i>, from 20 to 90, they had a separate character,
and for every <i>hundred</i>, and for every <i>thousand</i>. The
<i>thousands</i> were the units with a mark underneath. Thus
&#945; meant 1, and &#8115; meant 1,000. To express 113, Archimedes
would have written &#961;&#953;&#947;. To express 355, he would
have written &#964;&#957;&#949;; and the place which these signs had in
the order would not have affected their value, as they do
with us.</p>

<p>We cannot tell how the greater part of Archimedes's
life was spent. But whether he were nominally in public
office or not, it is clear enough that he must have given
great help to Syracuse and her rulers, as an engineer, long
before the war in which the Romans captured that great
city. At that time Syracuse was, according to Cicero,
"the largest and noblest of the Greek cities." It was in
Sicily; but, having been built by colonists from Greece,
who still spoke the Greek language, Cicero speaks of it
among Greek cities, as he would have spoken of Thurii,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
or Sybaris, or the cities of "Magna Gr&aelig;cia,"&mdash;"great
Greece," as they called the Greek settlements in southern
Italy. In the Second Punic War Syracuse took sides
against Rome with the Carthaginians, though her old
king, Hiero, had been a firm ally of the Romans. The
most interesting accounts that we have of Archimedes are
in Livy's account of this war, and in Plutarch's Life of
Marcellus, who carried it on on the Roman side. Livy
says of Archimedes that he was&mdash;</p>

<p>"A man of unrivalled skill in observing the heavens and
the stars, but more deserving of admiration as the inventor
and constructor of warlike engines and works, by means of
which, with a very slight effort, he turned to ridicule what
the enemy effected with great difficulty.</p>

<p>"The wall, which ran along unequal eminences, most of
which were high and difficult of access, some low and open
to approach along level vales, was furnished by him with
every kind of warlike engine, as seemed suitable to each
particular place. Marcellus attacked from the quinqueremes
[his large ships] the wall of the Achradina, which
was washed by the sea. From the other ships the archers
and slingers and light infantry, whose weapon is difficult to
be thrown back by the unskilful, allowed scarce any person
to remain upon the wall unwounded. These soldiers, as
they required some range in aiming their missiles upward,
kept their ships at a distance from the wall. Eight more
quinqueremes joined together in pairs, the oars on their
inner sides being removed, so that side might be placed
to side, and which thus formed ships [of double width],
and were worked by the outer oars, carried turrets built
up in stories, and other battering-engines.</p>

<p>"Against this naval armament Archimedes placed, on
different parts of the walls, engines of various dimensions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Against the ships which were at a distance he discharged
stones of immense weight; those which were nearer he
assailed with lighter and more numerous missiles. Lastly,
in order that his own men might heap their weapons upon
the enemy without receiving any wounds themselves, he
perforated the wall from the top to the bottom with a
great number of loop-holes, about a cubit in diameter,
through which some with arrows, others with scorpions of
moderate size, assailed the enemies without being seen.
He threw upon their sterns some of the ships which came
nearer to the walls, in order to get inside the range of
the engines, raising up their prows by means of an iron
grapple attached to a strong chain, by means of a <i>tolleno</i>
[or derrick], which projected from the wall and overhung
them, having a heavy counterpoise of lead which forced
the line to the ground. Then, the grapple being suddenly
disengaged, the ship, falling from the wall, was by these
means, to the utter consternation of the seamen, so dashed
against the water that even if it came back to its true
position it took in a great quantity of water."</p>

<p>"Fancy," cried Bedford, "one of their double quinqueremes,
when she had run bravely in under the shelter of
the wall. Just as the men think they can begin to work,
up goes the prow, and they all are tumbled down into the
steerage. Up she goes, and fifty rowers are on each other
in a pile; when the old pile-driver claw lets go again, and
down she comes, splash into the sea. And then Archimedes
pokes his head out through one of the holes, and
says in Greek, 'How do you like that, my friends?' I do
not wonder they were discouraged."</p>

<p>The bold cliff of the water front of Syracuse gave Archimedes
a particular advantage for defensive operations of
this sort. They are described in more detail in Plutarch's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Life of Marcellus, who was the Roman general employed
against Syracuse, and who was held at bay by Archimedes
for three years.</p>

<p>Here is Plutarch's account:&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marcellus, with sixty galleys, each with five rows of
oars, furnished with all sorts of arms and missiles, and
a huge bridge of planks laid upon eight ships chained
together,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> upon which was carried the engine to cast
stones and darts, assaulted the walls. He relied on the
abundance and magnificence of his preparations, and on
his own previous glory; all which, however, were, it would
seem, but trifles for Archimedes and his machines.</p>

<p>These machines he had designed and contrived, not
as matters of any importance, but as mere amusements
in geometry,&mdash;in compliance with King Hiero's desire
and request, some little time before, that he should reduce
to practice some part of his admirable speculations
in science, and by accommodating the theoretic truth to
sensation and ordinary use, bring it more within the
appreciation of people in general. Eudoxus and Archytas
had been the first originators of this far-famed and highly
prized art of mechanics, which they employed as an
elegant illustration of geometrical truths, and as a means
of sustaining experimentally, to the satisfaction of the
senses, conclusions too intricate for proof by words and
diagrams. As, for example, to solve the problem so
often required in constructing geometrical figures, "Given
the two extremes to find the two mean lines of a proportion,"
both these mathematicians had recourse to the aid
of instruments, adapting to their purpose certain curves
and sections of lines. But what with Plato's indignation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>at it, and his invectives against it as the mere corruption
and annihilation of the one good of geometry, which
was thus shamefully turning its back upon the unembodied
objects of pure intelligence, to recur to sensation,
and to ask help (not to be obtained without base subservience
and depravation) from matter; so it was that
mechanics came to be separated from geometry, and
when repudiated and neglected by philosophers, took
its place as a military art.</p>

<p>Archimedes, however, in writing to King Hiero, whose
friend and near relative he was, had stated that, given
the force, any given weight might be moved; and even
boasted, we are told, relying on the strength of demonstration,
that if there were another earth, by going into
it he could move this.</p>

<p>Hiero being struck with amazement at this, and entreating
him to make good this assertion by actual experiment,
and show some great weight moved by a small
engine, he fixed upon a ship of burden out of the king's
arsenal, which could not be drawn out of the dock without
great labor by many men. Loading her with many
passengers and a full freight, sitting himself the while far
off, with no great endeavor, but only holding the head
of the pulley in his hand and drawing the cord by degrees,
he drew the ship in a straight line, as smoothly and
evenly as if she had been in the sea.</p>

<p>The king, astonished at this, and convinced of the
power of the art, prevailed upon Archimedes to make
him engines accommodated to all the purposes, offensive
and defensive, of a siege. These the king himself never
made use of, because he spent almost all his life in a
profound quiet and the highest affluence. But the apparatus
was, in a most opportune time, ready at hand for
the Syracusans, and with it also the engineer himself.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<p>When, therefore, the Romans assaulted the walls in
two places at once, fear and consternation stupefied the
Syracusans, believing that nothing was able to resist that
violence and those forces. But when Archimedes began
to ply his engines, he at once shot against the land forces
all sorts of missile weapons, with immense masses of
stone that came down with incredible noise and violence,
against which no man could stand; for they knocked
down those upon whom they fell in heaps, breaking all
their ranks and files. In the mean time huge poles thrust
out from the walls over the ships [these were the derricks,
or <i>tollenos</i>, of Livy] sunk some by the great weights which
they let down from on high upon them; others they
lifted up into the air by an iron hand or beak like a
crane's beak, and when they had drawn them up by the
prow, and set them on end upon the poop, they plunged
them to the bottom of the sea. Or else the ships, drawn
by engines within, and whirled about, were dashed against
the steep rocks that stood jutting out under the walls,
with great destruction of the soldiers that were aboard
them. A ship was frequently lifted up to a great height
in the air (a dreadful thing to behold), and was rolled
to and fro and kept swinging, until the mariners were
all thrown out, when at length it was dashed against the
rocks, or let fall.</p>

<p>At the engine that Marcellus brought upon the bridge
of ships,&mdash;which was called <i>Sambuca</i> from some resemblance
it had to an instrument of music of that name,&mdash;while
it was as yet approaching the wall, there was discharged
a piece of a rock of ten talents' weight,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> then
a second and a third, which, striking upon it with immense
force and with a noise like thunder, broke all its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
foundation to pieces, shook out all its fastenings, and
completely dislodged it from the bridge. So Marcellus,
doubtful what counsel to pursue, drew off his ships to
a safer distance, and sounded a retreat to his forces on
land. They then took a resolution of coming up under
the walls, if it were possible, in the night; thinking that
as Archimedes used ropes stretched at length in playing
his engines, the soldiers would now be under the shot, and
the darts would, for want of sufficient distance to throw
them, fly over their heads without effect. But he, it
appeared, had long before framed for such occasion
engines accommodated to any distance, and shorter
weapons; and had made numerous small openings in
the walls, through which, with engines of a shorter range,
unexpected blows were inflicted on the assailants. Thus,
when they, who thought to deceive the defenders, came
close up to the walls, instantly a shower of darts and
other missile weapons was again cast upon them. And
when stones came tumbling down perpendicularly upon
their heads, and, as it were, the whole wall shot out arrows
against them, they retired.</p>

<p>And now, again, as they were going off, arrows and
darts of a longer range inflicted a great slaughter among
them, and their ships were driven one against another,
while they themselves were not able to retaliate in any
way. For Archimedes had provided and fixed most of
his engines immediately under the wall; whence the
Romans, seeing that infinite mischiefs overwhelmed them
from no visible means, began to think they were fighting
with the gods.</p>

<p>Yet Marcellus escaped unhurt, and, deriding his own
artificers and engineers, "What," said he, "must we give
up fighting with this geometrical Briareus, who plays<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
pitch and toss with our ships, and with the multitude of
darts which he showers at a single moment upon us,
really outdoes the hundred-handed giants of mythology?"
And doubtless the rest of the Syracusans were but the
body of Archimedes's designs, one soul moving and
governing all; for, laying aside all other arms, with his
alone they infested the Romans and protected themselves.
In fine, when such terror had seized upon the
Romans that if they did but see a little rope or a piece
of wood from the wall, instantly crying out that there it
was again, that Archimedes was about to let fly some engine
at them, they turned their backs and fled, Marcellus
desisted from conflicts and assaults, putting all his hope
in a long siege. Yet Archimedes possessed so high a
spirit, so profound a soul, and such treasures of scientific
knowledge, that though these inventions had now
obtained him the renown of more than human sagacity,
he yet would not deign to leave behind him any commentary
or writing on such subjects; but, repudiating
as sordid and ignoble the whole trade of engineering,
and every sort of art that lends itself to mere use and
profit, he placed his whole affection and ambition in
those purer speculations where there can be no reference
to the vulgar needs of life,&mdash;studies the superiority of
which to all others is unquestioned, and in which the
only doubt can be whether the beauty and grandeur of
the subjects examined or the precision and cogency
of the methods and means of proof most deserve our
admiration.</p>

<p>It is not possible to find in all geometry more difficult
and intricate questions, or more simple and lucid explanations.
Some ascribe this to his natural genius; while
others think that incredible toil produced these, to all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
appearance, easy and unlabored results. No amount
of investigation of yours would succeed in attaining the
proof; and yet, once seen, you immediately believe you
would have discovered it,&mdash;by so smooth and so rapid
a path he leads you to the conclusion required. And
thus it ceases to be incredible that (as is commonly told
of him) the charm of his familiar and domestic science
made him forget his food and neglect his person to that
degree that when he was occasionally carried by absolute
violence to bathe, or have his body anointed, he used
to trace geometrical figures in the ashes of the fire, and
diagrams in the oil on his body, being in a state of entire
preoccupation, and, in the truest sense, divine possession,
with his love and delight in science. His discoveries
were numerous and admirable; but he is said to have
requested his friends and relations that when he was
dead they would place over his tomb a sphere containing a cylinder,
inscribing it with the ratio which the
containing solid bears to the contained.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The boys were highly edified by this statement of the
difficulty which Archimedes's friends found in making him
take a bath, and chaffed Jack, who had asked if he were
not the inventor of bath-tubs.</p>

<p>When the reading from Plutarch was over, Fergus
asked if that were all, and was disappointed that there
was nothing about the setting of ships on fire by mirrors.
It is one of the old stories of the siege of Syracuse, that
he set fire to the Roman ships by concentrating on them
the heat of the sun from a number of mirrors. But this
story is not in Livy, nor is it in Plutarch, though, as has
been seen, they were well disposed to tell what they knew
which was marvellous in his achievements. It is told at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
length and in detail by Zonaras and Tzetzes, two Greek
writers of the twelfth century, who must have found it in
some ancient writers whose works we do not now have.</p>

<p>"Archimedes," says Zonaras,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> "having received the
rays of the sun on a mirror, by the thickness and polish
of which they were reflected and united, kindled a flame
in the air, and darted it with full violence upon the ships,
which were anchored within a certain distance, in such
a manner that they were burned to ashes."</p>

<p>The same writer says that Proclus, a celebrated
"mathematician" of Constantinople, in the sixth century,
at the siege of Constantinople set fire to the Thracian
fleet by means of brass mirrors. Tzetzes is yet more
particular. He says that when the Roman galleys were
within a bow-shot of the city walls, Archimedes brought
together hexagonal specula (mirrors) with other smaller
ones of twenty-four facets, and caused them to be placed
each at a proper distance; that he moved these by means
of hinges and plates of metal; that the hexagon was bisected
by the meridian of summer and winter; that it was
placed opposite the sun; and that a great fire was thus
kindled, which consumed the ships.</p>

<p>Now, it is to be remembered that these are the
accounts of writers who were not so good mechanics as
Archimedes. It should be remembered, also, that in
the conditions of war then, the distance at which ships
would be anchored in a little harbor like that of Syracuse
was not great. By "bow-shot" would be meant the
distance at which a bow would do serious damage.
Doubtful as the story of Zonaras and Tzetzes seems, it
received unexpected confirmation in the year 1747 from
a celebrated experiment tried by the naturalist Buffon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>After encountering many difficulties, which he had
foreseen with great acuteness, and obviated with equal
ingenuity, Buffon at length succeeded in repeating Archimedes's
performance. In the spring of 1747 he
laid before the French Academy a memoir which, in his
collected works, extends over upwards of eighty pages.
In this paper he described himself as in possession of an
apparatus by means of which he could set fire to planks at
the distance of 200 and even 210 feet, and melt metals
and metallic minerals at distances varying from 25 to 40
feet. This apparatus he describes as composed of 168
plain glasses, silvered on the back, each six inches broad
by eight inches long. These, he says, were ranged in a
large wooden frame, at intervals not exceeding the third
of an inch, so that, by means of an adjustment behind,
each should be movable in all directions independent of
the rest; the spaces between the glasses being further of
use in allowing the operator to see from behind the point
on which it behooved the various disks to be converged.</p>

<p>In this last statement there is a parallel with that of
Tzetzes, who speaks of the division of Archimedes's
mirrors.</p>

<p>At the present moment naturalists are paying great attention
to plans for the using of the heat of the sun. It is
said that on any county in the United States, twenty by
thirty miles square, there is wasted as much heat of the
sun as would drive, if we knew how to use it, all the
steam-engines in the world.</p>

<p>Fergus asked Uncle Fritz if he believed that Archimedes
threw seven hundred pounds of stone from one of his
machines. The largest modern guns throw shot of one
thousand pounds, and it is only quite recently that any
such shot have been used.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>Uncle Fritz told him that in the museum at St. Germain-en-Laye
he would one day see a modern catapult,
made by Colonel de Reffye from the design of a Roman
catapult on Trajan's Column. This is supposed to be of
the same pattern which is called an "Onager" in the
Latin books. This catapult throws, when it is tested, a
shot of twenty-four pounds, or it throws a sheaf of short
arrows. In one catapult the power is gained by twisting
ox-hide very tightly, and suddenly releasing it. Another is
a very stout bow, worked with a small windlass. Of course
this will give a great power.</p>

<p>Seven hundred pounds, however, seems beyond the
ability of any such machines as this; but from his higher
walls Archimedes could, of course, have rolled such stones
down on the decks of the ships below. And if he were
throwing other stones or leaden balls to a greater distance
with his <i>Onagers</i>, it may well be that Plutarch or Livy did
not take very accurate account of the particular engine
which threw one stone or another.</p>

<p>Archimedes was killed by a Roman soldier, to the
great grief of Marcellus, when the Romans finally took
Syracuse. The city fell through drunkenness, which was,
and is, the cause of more failure in the world than
anything else which can be named. Marcellus, in some
conversations about the exchange or redemption of a prisoner,
observed a tower somewhat detached from the wall,
which was, as he thought, carelessly guarded. Choosing
the night of a feast of Diana, when the Syracusans were
wholly given up to wine and sport, he took the tower by
surprise, and from the tower seized the wall and made his
way into the city. In the sack of the city by the soldiers,
which followed, Archimedes was killed. The story is
told in different ways. Plutarch says that he was working<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
out some problem by a diagram, and never noticed the
incursion of the Romans, nor that the city was taken.
A soldier, unexpectedly coming up to him in this transport
of study and meditation, commanded him to follow
him to Marcellus; which he declining to do before he had
worked out his problem to a demonstration, the soldier,
enraged, drew his sword, and ran him through. "Others
write that a Roman soldier, running upon him with a drawn
sword, offered to kill him, and that Archimedes, looking
back, earnestly besought him to hold his hand a little
while, that he might not leave what he was then at work
upon inconsequent and imperfect; but the soldier, not
moved by his entreaty, instantly killed him. Others,
again, relate that as Archimedes was carrying to Marcellus
mathematical instruments, dials, spheres, and angles by
which the magnitude of the sun might be measured to
the sight, some soldiers, seeing him, and thinking that he
carried gold in a vessel, slew him.</p>

<p>"Certain it is, that his death was very afflicting to Marcellus,
and that Marcellus ever after regarded him that
killed him as a murderer, and that he sought for the
kindred of Archimedes and honored them with signal
honors."</p>

<p>Archimedes, as has been said, had asked that his monument
might be a cylinder bearing a sphere, in commemoration
of his discovery of the proportion between a
cylinder and a sphere of the same diameter. A century
and a half after, when Cicero was qu&aelig;stor of Sicily, he
found this monument, neglected, forgotten, and covered
with a rank growth of thistles and other weeds.</p>

<p>"It was left," he says, "for one who came from Arpinas,
to show to the men of Syracuse where their greatest
countryman lay buried."</p>

<small>FRIAR BACON.</small></h2>


<p>"All the world seems to have known of Columbus's
discoveries as soon as he came home, but all the
world did not know at once of Archimedes's inventions;
indeed, I should think the world did not know now what
all of them are."</p>

<p>Hester Van Brunt was saying this in the hall, as the
girls laid off their waterproofs, when they next met the
Colonel.</p>

<p>"I think that may often be said of what we call Inventions
and what we call Discoveries," he said, "till quite
recent times. When a man invented a new process, it was
supposed that if he could keep the secret, it might be to
him a very valuable secret. But when one discovered an
island or a continent, it was almost impossible to keep the
secret. They tried it sometimes, as you know. But there
must be a whole ship's crew who know something of the
new-found land, and from some of them the secret would
leak out.</p>

<p>"But there has been many a process in the arts lost,
because the man who discovered the new quality in nature
or invented the new method in manufacture kept it secret,
so that he might do better work than his competitors.
This went so far that boys were apprenticed to masters
to learn 'the secrets of their trades.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>Fergus said that in old times inventors were not always
treated very kindly. If people thought they were sorcerers,
or in league with the Devil, they did not care much for
the invention.</p>

<p>Uncle Fritz said they would find plenty of instances of
the persecution of inventors, even to quite a late date.
It is impossible, of course, to say how many good things
were lost to the world by the pig-headedness which discouraged
new inventions. It is marvellous to think what
progress single men made, who had to begin almost at
the beginning, and learn for themselves what every intelligent
boy or girl now finds ready for him in the
Cyclop&aelig;dia. It is very clear that the same beginnings
were made again and again by some of the early inventors.
Then, what they learned had been almost forgotten. There
was no careful record of their experiments, or, if any, it
was in one manuscript, and that was not accessible to
people trying to follow in their steps.</p>

<p>"I have laid out for you," said Uncle Fritz, "some of
the early accounts of Friar Bacon,&mdash;Roger Bacon. He is
one of the most distinguished of the early students of what
we now call natural philosophy in England. It was in one
of the darkest centuries of the Dark Ages.</p>

<p>"But see what he did.</p>

<p>"There are to be found in his writings new and ingenious
views of Optics,&mdash;as, on the refraction of light, on the
apparent magnitude of objects, on the magnified appearance
of the sun and moon when on the horizon. He
describes very exactly the nature and effects of concave
and convex lenses, and speaks of their application to the
purposes of reading and of viewing distant objects, both
terrestrial and celestial; and it is easy to prove from his
writings that he was either the inventor or the improver of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
the telescope. He also gives descriptions of the camera
obscura and of the burning-glass. He made, too, several
chemical discoveries. In one place he speaks of an inextinguishable
fire, which was probably a kind of phosphorus.
In another he says that an artificial fire could be prepared
with saltpetre and other ingredients which would burn at
the greatest distance, and by means of which thunder and
lightning could be imitated. He says that a portion of this
mixture of the size of an inch, properly prepared, would
destroy a whole army, and even a city, with a tremendous
explosion accompanied by a brilliant light. In another
place he says distinctly that thunder and lightning could
be imitated by means of saltpetre, sulphur, and charcoal.
As these are the ingredients of gunpowder, it is clear that
he had an adequate idea of its composition and its power.
He was intimately acquainted with geography and astronomy.
He had discovered the errors of the calendar
and their causes, and in his proposals for correcting them
he approached very nearly to the truth. He made a corrected
calendar, of which there is a copy in the Bodleian
Library in Oxford. In moral philosophy, also, Roger
Bacon has laid down some excellent precepts for the
conduct of life.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>"Now, if you had such a biography of such a man now,
you would know that without much difficulty you could
find all his more important observations in print. So soon
as he thought them important, he would communicate
them to some society which would gladly publish them.
In the first place, he would be glad to have the credit of
an improvement, an invention, or a discovery. If the invention
were likely to be profitable, the nation would secure
the profit to him if he fully revealed the process. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
would give him, by a 'patent,' the right to the exclusive
profit for a series of years. The nation thus puts an end
to the old temptation to secrecy, or tries to do so.</p>

<p>"But if you will read some of the queer passages from
the old lives of Bacon, you will see how very vague were
the notions which the people of his own time had of what
he was doing."</p>

<p>Then Hester read some passages which Colonel Ingham
had marked for her.</p>

<h3>OF THE PARENTS AND BIRTH OF FRYER BACON,
AND HOW HE ADDICTED HIMSELF TO LEARNING.</h3>

<p>In most men's opinions he was born in the West part
of <i>England</i> and was son to a wealthy Farmer, who put him
to School to the Parson of the Town where he was born:
not with intent that he should turn Fryer (as he did), but
to get so much understanding, that he might manage the
better that wealth he was to leave him. But young <i>Bacon</i>
took his learning so fast, that the Priest could not teach
him any more, which made him desire his Master that he
would speak to his father to put him to <i>Oxford</i>, that he
might not lose that little learning that he had gained:
his Master was very willing so to do: and one day, meeting
his father, told him, that he had received a great blessing
of God, in that he had given him so wise and hopeful
a Child as his son <i>Roger Bacon</i> was (for so was he named)
and wished him withal to doe his duty, and to bring up so
his Child, that he might shew his thankfulness to God,
which could not better be done than in making him a
Scholar; for he found by his sudden taking of his learning,
that he was a child likely to prove a very great Clerk:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>hereat old <i>Bacon</i> was not well pleased (for he desired to
bring him up to Plough and to the Cart, as he himself was
brought) yet he for reverence sake to the Priest, shewed
not his anger, but kindly thanked him for his paines and
counsel, yet desired him not to speak any more concerning
that matter, for he knew best what best pleased himself,
and that he would do: so broke they off their talk
and parted.</p>

<p>So soon as the old man came home, he called to his
son for his books, which when he had, he locked them up,
and gave the Boy a Cart Whip in place of them, saying to
him: "Boy, I will have you no Priest, you shall not be
better learned than I, you can tell by the Almanack when
it is best sowing Wheat, when Barley, Peas and Beans:
and when the best libbing is, when to sell Grain and Cattle
I will teach thee; for I have all Fairs and Markets as
perfect in my memory, as Sir <i>John</i>, our Priest, has Mass
without Book: take me this Whip, I will teach the use
of it. It will be more profitable to thee than this harsh
Latin: make no reply, but follow my counsel, or else by
the Mass thou shalt feel the smart hand of my anger."
Young <i>Bacon</i> thought this but hard dealing, yet he would
not reply, but within six or eight days he gave his Father
the slip, and went to a Cloister some twenty miles off,
where he was entertained, and so continued his Learning,
and in small time came to be so famous, that he was sent
for to the University of Oxford, where he long time
studied, and grew so excellent in the secrets of Art and
Nature, that not England only, but all Christendom, admired
him.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<h3>HOW FRYER BACON MADE A BRAZEN HEAD TO
SPEAK, BY THE WHICH HE WOULD HAVE
WALLED ENGLAND ABOUT WITH BRASS.</h3>

<p>Fryer <i>Bacon</i>, reading one day of the many conquests
of England, bethought himself how he might keep it hereafter
from the like conquests, and so make himself famous
hereafter to all posterity. This (after great study) he
found could be no way so well done as one; which was
to make a head of Brass, and if he could make this head
to speak (and hear it when it speaks) then might he be
able to wall all England about with Brass. To this purpose
he got one Fryer <i>Bungy</i> to assist him, who was a
great Scholar and a Magician, (but not to be compared to
Fryer <i>Bacon</i>), these two with great study and pains so
framed a head of Brass, that in the inward parts thereof
there was all things like as in a natural man's head: this
being done, they were as far from perfection of the work
as they were before, for they knew not how to give those
parts that they had made motion, without which it was
impossible that it should speak: many books they read,
but yet could not find out any hope of what they sought,
that at the last they concluded to raise a spirit, and to
know of him that which they could not attain to by their
own studies. To do this they prepared all things ready
and went one Evening to a wood thereby, and after many
ceremonies used, they spake the words of conjuration,
which the Devil straight obeyed and appeared unto them,
asking what they would? "Know," said Fryer <i>Bacon</i>,
"that we have made an artificial head of Brass, which we
would have to speak, to the furtherance of which we have
raised thee, and being raised, we will keep thee here, un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>less
thou tell to us the way and manner how to make this
Head to speak." The Devil told him that he had not that
power of himself: "Beginner of lies," said Fryer <i>Bacon</i>,
"I know that thou wouldst dissemble, and therefore tell it
us quickly, or else we will here bind thee to remain during
our pleasures." At these threatenings the Devil consented
to do it, and told them, that with a continual fume
of the six hottest simples it should have motion, and in
one month space speak, the Time of the month or day he
knew not: also he told them, that if they heard it not before
it had done speaking, all their labour should be lost:
they being satisfied, licensed the Spirit for to depart.</p>

<p>Then went these two learned Fryers home again, and
prepared the Simples ready, and made the fume, and
with continual watching attended when this Brazen-head
would speak: thus watched they for three weeks without
any rest, so that they were so weary and sleepy, that they
could not any longer refrain from rest: then called Fryer
<i>Bacon</i> his man <i>Miles</i>, and told him, that it was not unknown
to him what pains Fryer <i>Bungy</i> and himself had
taken for three weeks space, only to make, and to hear
the Brazen-head speak, which if they did not, then had
they lost all their labour, and all England had a great loss
thereby: therefore he entreated Miles that he would watch
whilst that they slept, and call them if the Head speake.
"Fear not, good Master," said Miles, "I will not sleep,
but hearken and attend upon the head, and if it do
chance to speak, I will call you: therefore I pray take you
both your rests and let me alone for watching this head."
After Fryer <i>Bacon</i> had given him a great charge the second
time, Fryer <i>Bungy</i> and he went to sleep, and <i>Miles</i>,
alone to watch the Brazen-head. <i>Miles</i> to keep himself
from sleeping, got a Tabor and Pipe, and being merry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
disposed sang him many a merry Song; and thus with his
own Music and his Songs spent he his time, and kept from
sleeping at last. After some noise the Head spake these
two words: "<i>Time is</i>." Miles hearing it to speak no
more, thought his Master would be angry if he waked him
for that, and therefore he let them both sleep, and began
to mock the Head in this manner: "Thou Brazen-faced
Head, hath my Master took all this pains about thee, and
now dost thou requite him with two words, <i>Time is</i>? had
he watched with a Lawyer so long as he hath watched
with thee, he would have given him more, and better
words than thou hast yet. If thou canst speak no wiser,
they shall sleep till doom's day for me. <i>Time is</i>: I know
<i>Time is</i>, and that thou shall hear, good man Brazen face."
And with this he sang him a song to his own music as to
times and seasons, and went on, "Do you tell us, Copper-nose,
when Time is? I hope we Scholars know our
Times, when to drink drunk, when to kiss our hostess,
when to go on her score, and when to pay it, that
time comes seldom." After half an hour had passed, the
Head did speak again, two words, which were these:
"<i>Time was</i>." <i>Miles</i> respected these words as little as he
did the former, and would not wake them, but still scoffed
at the Brazen head, that it had learned no better words,
and have such a Tutor as his Master: and in scorn of it
sung a Song to the tune of "A Rich Merchant man," beginning
as follows:</p>

<p class="poem">
Time was when thou a kettle<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wert filled with better matter:</span><br />
But Fryer <i>Bacon</i> did thee spoil,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he thy sides did batter,</span><br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">with more to the same purpose. "<i>Time was</i>," said he,
"I know that, Brazen face, without your telling, I know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Time was, and I know what things there was when
Time was, and if you speak no wiser, no Master shall be
waked for me." Thus <i>Miles</i> talked and sung till another
half hour was gone, then the Brazen head spake again
these words, "<i>Time is past</i>:" and therewith fell down, and
presently followed a terrible noise, with strange flashes of
fire, so that <i>Miles</i> was half dead with fear. At this noise
the two Fryers awaked, and wondered to see the whole
room so full of smoke, but that being vanished they might
perceive the Brazen head broken and lying on the ground:
at this sight they grieved, and called <i>Miles</i> to know how
this came. Miles half dead with fear, said that it fell
down of itself, and that with the noise and fire that followed
he was almost frighted out of his wits: Fryer <i>Bacon</i>
asked him if he did not speak? "Yes," quoth <i>Miles</i>,
"it spake, but to no purpose. I'll have a Parrot speak
better in that time than you have been teaching this
Brazen head." "Out on thee, villain," said Fryer <i>Bacon</i>,
"thou hast undone us both, hadst thou but called us when
it did speak, all England had been walled round about with
Brass, to its glory, and our eternal fames: what were the
words it spake?" "Very few," said <i>Miles</i>, "and those
none of the wisest that I have heard neither: first he
said, '<i>Time is</i>.'" "Hadst thou called us then," said
Fryer <i>Bacon</i>, "we had been made for ever." "Then,"
said <i>Miles</i>, "half an hour after it spake again and said
'<i>Time was</i>.'" "And wouldst thou not call us then?"
said <i>Bungy</i>. "Alas!" said <i>Miles</i>, "I thought he would
have told me some long Tale, and then I purposed to
have called you: then half an hour after, he cried '<i>Time
is past</i>,' and made such a noise, that he hath waked you
himself, methinks." At this Fryer <i>Bacon</i> was in such a
rage, that he would have beaten his man, but he was re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>strained
by <i>Bungy</i>: but nevertheless for his punishment,
he with his Art struck him dumb for one whole month's
space. Thus that great work of these learned Fryers was
overthrown (to their great griefs) by this simple fellow.</p>


<h3>HOW FRYER BACON BY HIS ART TOOK A TOWN,
WHEN THE KING HAD LAIN BEFORE IT THREE
MONTHS, WITHOUT DOING IT ANY HURT.</h3>

<p>In those times when Fryer <i>Bacon</i> did all his strange
tricks, the Kings of <i>England</i> had a great part of <i>France</i>
which they held a long time, till civil wars at home in this
Land made them to lose it. It did chance that the King
of England (for some cause best known to himself) went
into <i>France</i> with a great Army, where after many victories,
he did besiege a strong Town, and lay before it full
three months, without doing to the Town any great damage,
but rather received the hurt himself. This did so
vex the King, that he sought to take it in any way, either
by policy or strength: to this intent he made Proclamation,
that whosoever could deliver this Town into his
hand, he should have for his pains ten thousand Crowns
truly paid. This was proclaimed, but there was none
found that would undertake it: at length the news did
come into <i>England</i> of this great reward that was promised.
Fryer <i>Bacon</i> hearing of it, went into <i>France</i>, and
being admitted to the King's presence, he thus spake
unto him: "Your Majesty I am sure hath not forgot
your poor servant <i>Bacon</i>, the love that you showed to me
being last in your presence, hath drawn me for to leave
my Country and my Studies, to do your Majesty service:
I beseech your Grace, to command me so far as my poor
Art or life may do you pleasure." The King thanked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
him for his love, but told him that he had now more need
of Arms than Art, and wanted brave Soldiers rather than
learned Scholars. Fryer <i>Bacon</i> answered, "Your Grace
saith well; but let me (under correction) tell you, that
Art oftentimes doth these things that are impossible to
Arms, which I will make good in few examples. I will
speak only of things performed by Art and Nature, wherein
there shall be nothing Magical: and first by the figuration
of Art, there may be made Instruments of Navigation
without men to row in them, as great ships, to brook the
Sea, only with one man to steer them, and they shall sail
far more swiftly than if they were full of men: Also Chariots
that shall move with an unspeakable force, without
any living creature to stir them. Likewise, an Instrument
may be made to fly withal, if one sit in the midst of the
Instrument, and do turn an engine, by which the wings
being Artificially composed, may beat air after the manner
of a flying Bird. By an Instrument of three fingers
high, and three fingers broad, a man may rid himself
and others from all Imprisonment: yea, such an Instrument
may easily be made, whereby a man may violently
draw unto him a thousand men, will they, nill they, or any
other thing. By Art also an Instrument may be made,
wherewith men may walk in the bottom of the Sea or
Rivers without bodily danger: this <i>Alexander</i> the Great
used (as the Ethnic philosopher reporteth) to the end he
might behold the Secrets of the Seas. But Physical Figurations
are far more strange: for by that may be framed
Perspects and Looking-glasses, that one thing shall appear
to be many, as one man shall appear to be a whole Army,
and one Sun or Moon shall seem divers. Also perspects
may be so framed, that things far off shall seem most nigh
unto us: with one of these did <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Sea coasts in <i>France</i> marke and observe the situation of
the Castles in <i>England</i>. Bodies may also be so framed,
that the greatest things shall appear to be the least, the
highest lowest, the most secret to be the most manifest,
and in such like sort the contrary. Thus did <i>Socrates</i>
perceive, that the Dragon which did destroy the City and
Country adjoining with his noisome breath, and contagious
influence, did lurk in the dens between the Mountains:
and thus may all things that are done in Cities or
Armies be discovered by the enemies. Again, in such
wise may bodies be framed, that venemous and infectious
influences may be brought whither a man will: In this
did <i>Aristotle</i> instruct <i>Alexander</i>; through which instruction
the poyson of a Basiliske, being lifted up upon the wall of
a City, the poyson was conveyed into the City, to the destruction
thereof: Also perspects may be made to deceive
the sight, as to make a man believe that he seeth
great store of riches when there is not any. But it appertaineth
to a higher power of Figuration, that beams should
be brought and assembled by divers flections and reflections
in any distance that we will, to burne anything that
is opposite unto it, as is witnessed by those Perspects or
Glasses that burn before and behind. But the greatest
and chiefest of all figurations and things figured, is to describe
the heavenly bodies, according to their length and
breadth in a corporal figure, wherein they may corporally
move with a daily motion. These things are worth a
kingdom to a wise man. These may suffise, my royal
Lord, to shew what Art can do: and these, with many
things more, as strange, I am able by Art to perform.
Then take no thought for winning this Town, for by my
Art you shall (ere many days be past) have your desire."</p>

<p>The King all this while heard him with admiration: but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
hearing him now, that he would undertake to win the
Town, he burst out in these speeches: "Most learned
<i>Bacon</i>, do but what thou hast said, and I will give thee
what thou most desirest, either wealth or honour, choose
what thou wilt, and I will be as ready to perform, as I
have been to promise."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty's love is all that I seek," said the Fryer,
"let me have that, and I have honour enough, for wealth,
I have content, the wise should seek no more: but to the
purpose. Let your Pioneers raise up a mount so high, (or
rather higher), than the wall, and then you shall see some
probability of that which I have promised."</p>

<p>This Mount in two days was raised: then Fryer <i>Bacon</i>
went with the King to the Top of it, and did with a perspect
shew to him the Town, as plainly as if he had been
in it: at this the King did wonder, but Fryer <i>Bacon</i> told
him, that he should wonder more, ere next day noon:
against which Time, he desired him to have his whole
Army in readiness, for to scale the wall upon a signal given
by him, from the Mount. This the King promised to do,
and so returned to his Tent full of Joy, that he should gain
this strong Town. In the morning Fryer <i>Bacon</i> went up
to the Mount and set his Glasses, and other Instruments
up: in the meantime the King ordered his Army, and
stood in a readiness for to give the assaults: when the signal
was given which was the waving of a flag. Ere nine
of the clock Fryer <i>Bacon</i> had burnt the State-house of the
Town, with other houses only by his Mathematical Glasses,
which made the whole Town in an uproar, for none did
know how it came: whilst that they were quenching of the
same, Fryer <i>Bacon</i> did wave his flag: upon which signal
given, the King set upon the Town, and took it with little
or no resistance. Thus through the Art of this learned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
man the King got this strong Town, which he could not
do with all his men without Fryer <i>Bacon's</i> help.</p>


<h3>HOW FRYER BACON BURNT HIS BOOKS OF MAGIC
AND GAVE HIMSELF TO THE STUDY OF DIVINITY
ONLY; AND HOW HE TURNED ANCHORITE.</h3>

<p>Now in a time when Fryer <i>Bacon</i> kept his Chamber
(having some great grief) he fell into divers meditations:
sometimes into the vanity of Arts and Sciences: then
would he condemn himself for studying of those things
that were so contrary to his Order and Soul's health; and
would say that Magic made a Man a Devil; sometimes
would he meditate on Divinity; then would he cry out
upon himself for neglecting the study of it, and for studying
Magic: sometime would he meditate on the shortness
of man's life, then would he condemn himself for spending
a time so short, so ill as he had done his: so would he go
from one thing to another and in all condemn his former
studies.</p>

<p>And that the world should know how truly he did repent
his wicked life, he caused to be made a great fire; and
sending for many of his Friends, Scholars, and others, he
spake to them after this manner: "My good Friends and
fellow Students, it is not unknown unto you, how that
through my Art I have attained to that credit, that few
men living ever had. Of the wonders that I have done,
all England can speak, both King and Commons: I have
unlocked the secret of Art and Nature, and let the world
see those things, that have layen hid since the death of
Hermes, that rare and profound Philosopher: My Studies
have found the secrets of the Stars; the Books that I have
made of them, do serve for Precedents to our greatest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Doctors, so excellent hath my Judgement been therein.
I likewise have found out the secrets of Trees, Plants and
Stones, with their several uses; yet all this knowledge of
mine I esteem so lightly, that I wish that I were ignorant,
and knew nothing: for the knowledge of these things, (as
I have truly found) serveth not to better a man in goodness,
but only to make him proud and think too well of
himself. What hath all my knowledge of nature's secrets
gained me? Only this, the loss of a better knowledge, the
loss of divine Studies, which makes the immortal part of
man (his Soul) blessed. I have found, that my knowledge
has been a heavy burden, and has kept down my good
thoughts: but I will remove the cause which are these
Books: which I do purpose here before you all to burn."
They all intreated him to spare the Books, because in them
there were those things that after-ages might receive great
benefit by. He would not hearken unto them but threw
them all into the fire, and in that flame burnt the greatest
learning in the world. Then did he dispose of all his
goods; some part he gave to poor Scholars, and some he
gave to other poor folks: nothing he left for himself: then
caused he to be made in the Church-wall a Cell, where he
locked himself in, and there remained till his death. His
time he spent in Prayer, Meditation and such Divine Exercises,
and did seek by all means to persuade men from
the study of Magic. Thus lived he some two years space
in that Cell, never coming forth: his meat and drink he
received in at a window, and at that window he did discourse
with those that came to him; His grave he digged
with his own nails, and was laid there when he dyed.
Thus was the Life and Death of this famous Fryer, who
lived the most part of his life a Magician, and died a true
penitent sinner and an Anchorite.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>When Hester had finished reading, one of the boys
said that if people believed such things as that, he thought
the wonder was that they made any progress at all. Uncle
Fritz said that in matters which make up what we call
science, they did not make much progress. The arts of
the world do not seem to have advanced much between
the days of Solomon and those of William the Conqueror.</p>

<p>"As you see," said Uncle Fritz, "an inventor was set
down as a magician. I think you can remember more
instances."</p>

<p>Yes. Almost all the young people remember that in
Marco Polo's day there was a distinguished Venetian engineer
with the armies of Genghis Khan, whose wonderful
successes gave rise, perhaps, to the story of Aladdin.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
The scene of his successes was Pekin; and it is to be remembered
that the story of Aladdin is not properly one of
the Arabian Nights, and that the scene is laid in China.</p>

<p>This led them to trying to match the wonders of Aladdin
and of the Arabian Nights by the wonders of modern
invention; and they pleased themselves by thinking of
marvels they could show to unlearned nations if they had
the resources of Mr. Edison's laboratory.</p>

<p>"Aladdin rubbed his lamp," said Blanche. "You see,
the lamp was his electrical machine; and when he rubbed
it, the lightnings went flying hither and thither, and said,
'Here we are.'"</p>

<p>"That is all very fine," said Jack Withers; "but I stand
by the Arabian Nights, after all, and I think I shall, till
Mr. Edison or the Taunton locomotive shop will make
for me some high-stepper on whose back I may rise
above the clouds, pass over the length and breadth of
Massachusetts, descend in the garden where Blanche is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
confined by the hated mistress of a boarding-school in
Walpole, and then, winning her ready consent, can mount
again with her, and before morning descend in the garden
of a beautiful cottage at Newport. We will spend six
weeks in playing tennis in the daytime, dancing in the
Casino in the evenings, and in sailing in Frank Shattuck's
yacht between whiles. Then, and not till then, would
I admit that the Arabian Nights have been outdone by
modern science."</p>

<p>They all laughed at Jack's extravaganza, which is of a
kind to which they are beginning to be accustomed. But
Mabel stuck to her text, and said seriously, that Uncle
Fred had said that what people now called science sprung
from the workshops of these very magicians. "The magicians
then had all the science there was. And if magic
had not got a bad name, should we not call the men of
science magicians now?"</p>

<p>Uncle Fritz said yes to all her questions, but he said
that they did not cover the whole matter. The difference
between a magician and a man of science involves these
habits: the magician keeps secret what he knows, while
the man of science discloses all he learns. Then the
magician affected to have spiritual power at command,
while the man of science only affects to use what he calls
physical powers. Till either of them tell us how to distinguish
spiritual forces from physical forces, the second
distinction is of the less importance. But the other has
made all the difference in the world between the poor
magic-men and the science-men. For, as they had seen
with Friar Bacon, the magic-men have had their stories
told by most ignorant people, seeing they did not generally
leave any records behind them; but the men of
modern science, having chosen to tell their own stories,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
have had them told, on the whole, reasonably well,
though generally stupidly.</p>

<p>"What a pity we have not Solomon's books of science!"
said John Tolman.</p>

<p>"It is one of the greatest of pities that such books as
those were not kept. It seems as if people would have
built on such foundations, and that Science would have
marched from step to step, instead of beginning over and
over again. But we do have Pliny's Natural History, as
he chose to call it. Far from building on that as a foundation,
the Dark Ages simply accepted it. And there are
blunders or sheer lies in that book, and in Aristotle's
books, and Theophrastus's, and other such, which have
survived even to our day."</p>

<p>The children were peeping into the collection from
which the Friar Bacon stories had been read, and they
lighted on these scraps about the supposed life of Virgil.
To the people of the Dark Ages Virgil was much more a
man of magic than a poet.</p>


<h3>HOW VIRGILIUS WAS SET TO SCHOOL.</h3>

<p>As Virgilius was born, then the town of Rome quaked
and trembled: and in his youth he was wise and subtle,
and was put to school at Tolentin, where he studied diligently,
for he was of great understanding. Upon a time
the scholars had licence to go to play and sport them in
the fields after the usance of the old time; and there was
also Virgilius thereby also walking among the hills all
about: it fortuned he spied a great hole in the side of a
great hill wherein he went so deep that he could not see
no more light, and then he went a little further therein,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
and then he saw some light again, and then went he forth
straight: and within a little while after, he heard a voice
that called, "Virgilius, Virgilius;" and he looked about,
and he could not see no body; then Virgilius spake and
asked, "Who calleth me?" Then heard he the voice
again, but he saw nobody: then said he, "Virgilius, see
ye not that little board lying beside you there, marked
with that word?" Then answered Virgilius, "I see that
board well enough." The voice said, "Do away that
board, and let me out thereat." Then answered Virgilius
to the voice that was under the little board, and said,
"Who art thou that talkest me so!" Then answered
the devil: "I am a devil, conjured out of the body of a
certain man, and banished till the day of judgement, without
I be delivered by the hands of men. Thus, Virgilius,
I pray you to deliver me out of this pain, and I shall
shew unto thee many books of necromancy, and how thou
shalt come by it lightly and know the practise therein,
that no man in the science of necromancy shall pass thee;
and moreover I shall shew and inform you so that thou
shalt have all thy desire, whereby methinks it is a great
gift for so little a doing, for ye may also thus all your
friends helpen, and make your enemies unmighty."
Through that great promise was Virgil tempted; he had
the fiend shew the books to him that he might have and
occupy them at his will. And so the fiend shewed him,
and then Virgilius pulled open a board, and there was a
little hole, and thereat crawled the devil out like an eel,
and came and stood before Virgilius like a big man;
thereat Virgilius was astonished and marvelled greatly
thereof that so great a man might come out at so little a
hole; then said Virgilius, "should ye well pass into the
hole that ye came out of?" "Yea, I shall well," said the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
devil.&mdash;"I hold the best pledge that I have, ye shall not
do it." "Well," said the devil, "thereto I consent."
And then the devil crawled into the little hole again, and
as he was therein, Virgilius covered the hole again, and
so was the devil beguiled, and might not there come out
again, but there abideth still therein. Then called the
devil dreadfully to Virgilius and said, "What have ye
done?" Virgilius answered, "Abide there still to your
day appointed." And from thenceforth abideth he there.
And so Virgilius became very cunning in the practise of
the black science.</p>


<h3>HOWE THE EMPEROR ASKED COUNSEL OF VIRGILIUS,
HOW THE NIGHT RUNNERS AND ILL
DOERS MIGHT BE RID-OUT OF THE STREETS.</h3>

<p>The emperor had many complaints of the night runners
and thieves, and also of the great murdering of
people in the night, in so much that the emperor asked
counsel of Virgilius, and said: "That he hath great complaints
of the thieves that runneth by night for they kill
many men; what counsel, Virgilius, is best to be done?"
Then answered Virgilius to the emperor, "Ye shall make
a horse of copper and a copper man upon his back,
having in his hands a flail of iron, and that horse, ye
shall so bring afore the towne house, and ye shall let cry
that a man from henceforth at ten of the clock should
ring a bell, and he that after the bell was rung in the
streets should be slain, no work thereof should be done."
And when this cry was made the ruffians set not a point,
but kept the streets as they did afore and would not let
therefor; and as soon as the bell was rung at ten of the
clock, then leaped the horse of copper with the copper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
man through the streets of Rome, insomuch that he left
not one street in Rome unsought; and as soon as he
found any man or woman in the street he slew them
stalk dead, insomuch that he slew above two hundred
persons or more. And this seeing, the thieves and night-runners
how they might find a remedy therefor, thought
in their minds to make a drag with a ladder thereon; and
as they would go out by night they took their ladders
with them, and when they heard the horse come, then
cast they the drag upon the houses, and so went up upon
their ladders to the top of the houses, so that the copper
man might not touch them; and so abide they still in
their wicked doing. Then came they again to the emperor
and complained, and then the emperor asked counsel
of Virgilius; and Virgilius answered and said, "that
then he must get two copper hounds and set them of
either side of the copper horse, and let cry again that
no body after the bell is rung should depart out of their
house that would live." But the night walkers cared not
a point for that cry; but when they heard the horse
coming, with their ladders climbed upon the houses, but
the dogs leaped after and tore them all in pieces; and
thus the noise went through Rome, in so much that nobody
durst in the night go in the street, and thus all the
night-walkers were destroyed.</p>


<h3>HOW VIRGILIUS MADE A LAMP THAT AT ALL
TIMES BURNED.</h3>

<p>For profit of the common people, Virgilius on a great
mighty marble pillar, did make a bridge that came up to
the palace, and so went Virgilius well up the pillar out of
the palace; that palace and pillar stood in the midst of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Rome; and upon this pillar made he a lamp of glass that
always burned without going out, and nobody might put
it out; and this lamp lightened over all the city of Rome
from the one corner to the other, and there was not so
little a street but it gave such light that it seemed two
torches there had stand; and upon the walls of the palace
made he a metal man that held in his hand a metal bow
that pointed ever upon the lamp for to shoot it out; but
always burned the lamp and gave light over all Rome.
And upon a time went the burgesses' daughters to play
in the palace and beheld the metal man; and one of them
asked in sport, why he shot not? And then she came to
the man and with her hand touched the bow, and then
the bolt flew out, and brake the lamp that Virgilius made;
and it was wonder that the maiden went not out of her
mind for the great fear she had, and also the other burgesses'
daughters that were in her company, of the great
stroke that it gave when it hit the lamp, and when they
saw the metal man so swiftly run his way; and never
after was he no more seen; and this foresaid lamp was
abiding burning after the death of Virgilius by the space
of three hundred years or more.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is on the wrecks and ruins recorded in such fables as
these that modern science is builded.</p>

<small>BENVENUTO CELLINI.</small></h2>


<p>"Now we will leave the fairy tales," said Uncle Fritz,
"and begin on modern times."</p>

<p>"Modern times means since 1492," said Alice,&mdash;"the
only date in history I am quite sure of, excepting 1866."</p>

<p>"Eighteen-hundred and sixty-six," said John Goodrich,&mdash;"the
<i>Annus Mirabilis</i>, celebrated for the birth of
Miss Alice Francis and Mr. J. G."</p>

<p>"Hush, hush! Uncle Fritz wants to say something."</p>

<p>"We will leave the fairy tales," said poor chicken-pecked
Uncle Fritz, "and begin with Benvenuto Cellini.
Who has seen any of his work?"</p>

<p>Several of the girls who had been in Europe remembered
seeing gold and silver work of Benvenuto Cellini's
in the museums. Uncle Fritz told them that the little
hand-bell used on his own tea-table was modelled at
Chicopee, in Massachusetts, from a bell which was the
design of Benvenuto Cellini; and he sent for the bell that
the children might see how ingenious was the ornamentation,
and how simply the different designs were connected
together.</p>

<p>He told Alice she might read first from Vasari's account
of him. Vasari's book, which the children now
saw for the first time, is a very entertaining one. Vasari
was himself an artist, of the generation just following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Michael Angelo. He was, indeed, the contemporary of
Raphael. But he is remembered now, not for his pictures,
nor for his work in architecture, both of which were
noted in his time, but for his lives of the most excellent
painters, sculptors, and architects, which was first published
in 1550. Benvenuto Cellini was born ten years before
Vasari, and here is a part of Vasari's life of him.</p>


<h3>LIFE OF BENVENUTO CELLINI.</h3>

<p>Benvenuto Cellini, citizen of Florence, born in 1500,
at present a sculptor, in his youth cultivated the goldsmith's
business, and had no equal in that branch. He
set jewels, and adorned them with diminutive figures,
exquisitely formed, and some of them so curious and
fanciful that nothing finer or more beautiful can be
conceived. At Rome he made for Pope Clement VII.
a button to be worn upon his pontifical habit, fixing a
diamond to it with the most exquisite art. He was
employed to make the stamps for the Roman mint,
and there never have been seen finer coins than those
that were struck in Rome at that period.</p>

<p>After the death of Pope Clement, Benvenuto returned
to Florence, where he made stamps with the head of
Duke Alessandro, for the mint, wonderfully beautiful.
Benvenuto, having at last devoted himself to sculpture
and casting statues, made in France many works, while
he was employed at the Court of King Francis I. He
afterwards came back to his native country, where he
executed in metal the statue of Perseus, who cut off
Medusa's head. This work was brought to perfection
with the greatest art and diligence imaginable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>Though I might here enlarge on the productions of
Benvenuto, who always shewed himself a man of great
spirit and vivacity, bold, active, enterprising, and formidable
to his enemies,&mdash;a man, in short, who knew
as well how to speak to princes as to exert himself in
his art,&mdash;I shall add nothing further, since he has written
an account of his life and works, and a treatise on goldsmith's
work as well as on casting statues and many other
subjects, with more art and eloquence than it is possible
for me to imitate. I shall therefore content myself with
this account of his chief performances.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Benvenuto was quite proud of his own abilities as a
writer. Very fortunately for us he has left his own
memoirs. Here is the introduction.</p>


<h3>BENVENUTO'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY.</h3>

<p>"It is a duty incumbent on upright and credible men
of all ranks, who have performed anything noble or
praiseworthy, to record, in their own writing, the events
of their lives; yet they should not commence this honorable
task before they have passed their fortieth year.
Such at least is my opinion, now that I have completed
my fifty-eighth year, and am settled in Florence.</p>

<p>"Looking back on some delightful and happy events of
my life, and on many misfortunes so truly overwhelming
that the appalling retrospect makes me wonder how I
reached this age, in vigor and prosperity, through God's
goodness, I have resolved to publish an account of my
life.</p>

<p>"My grandfather, Andrea Cellini, was still living when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
I was about three years of age, and he was then above
a hundred. As they were one day removing a water-pipe,
a large scorpion, which they had not perceived,
came out of it. The scorpion descended upon the ground
and had got under a great bench, when I, seeing it, ran
and caught it in my hand. This scorpion was of such
a size that whilst I held it in my little hand, it put out
its tail on one side, and on the other darted its two
mouths. I ran overjoyed to my grandfather, crying out,
'Grandfather, look at my pretty little crab!' The good
old man, who knew it to be a scorpion, was so frightened,
and so apprehensive for my safety, that he seemed ready
to drop down dead, and begged me with great eagerness
to give the creature to him; but I grasped it the
harder and cried, for I did not choose to part with it.
My father, who was in the house, ran to us upon hearing
the noise, and, happening just at that instant to espy a
pair of scissors, he laid hold of them, and, by caressing
and playing with me, he contrived to cut off the head
and tail of the scorpion. Then, finding I had received
no harm from the venomous reptile, he pronounced it
a happy omen."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>His father taught him to play upon the flute, and
wished him to devote himself to music; but his own
inclinations were different.</p>

<p>"Having attained the age of fifteen, I engaged myself,
against my father's inclinations, with a goldsmith named
Antonio di Sandro, an excellent artist and a very worthy
man. My father would not have him allow me any
wages; for this reason, that since I voluntarily applied
myself to this art, I might have an opportunity to with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>draw
whenever I thought proper. So great was my
inclination to improve, that in a few months I rivalled
the most skilful journeyman in the business, and began
to reap some fruits from my labor. I continued, however,
to play sometimes, through complaisance to my father,
either upon the flute or the horn; and I constantly drew
tears and deep sighs from him every time he heard me.
From a feeling of filial piety, I often gave him that satisfaction,
endeavoring to persuade him that it gave me
also particular pleasure.</p>

<p>"Once when I was staying at Pisa, my father wrote
to me in every letter exhorting me not to neglect my flute,
in which he had taken so much pains to instruct me.
Upon this, I entirely lost all inclination to return to him;
and to such a degree did I hate that abominable flute,
that I thought myself in a sort of paradise in Pisa, where
I never once played upon that instrument."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the age of twenty-three (in 1523), Cellini went to
Rome, where he did much work for the Pope, Clement
VII.</p>

<p>"About this time so dreadful an epidemic disease
prevailed in Rome, that several thousands died every
day. Somewhat terrified at this calamity, I began to
indulge myself in certain recreations, as the fancy took
me. On holidays I amused myself with visiting the
antiquities of that city, and sometimes took their figures
in wax; at other times, I made drawings of them. As
these antiquities are all ruinous edifices, where a number
of pigeons build their nests, I had a mind to divert myself
among them with my fowling-piece, and often returned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
home laden with pigeons of the largest size. But I never
chose to put more than a single ball into my piece, and in
this manner, being a good marksman, I procured a considerable
quantity of game. The fowling-piece was, both
on the inside and the outside, as bright as a looking-glass.
I likewise made the powder as fine as the minutest dust,
and in the use of it I discovered some of the most
admirable secrets that ever were known till this time.
When I had charged my piece with a quantity of powder
equal in weight to the fifth part of the ball, it carried two
hundred paces, point blank.</p>

<p>"While I was enjoying these pleasures, my spirits suddenly
revived. I no longer had my usual gloom, and
I worked to more purpose than when my attention was
wholly engrossed by business; on the whole, my gun
turned rather to my advantage than the contrary.</p>

<p>"All Italy was now up in arms, and the Constable
Bourbon, finding there were no troops in Rome, eagerly
advanced with his army towards that capital. Upon the
news of his approach, all the inhabitants took up arms.
I engaged fifty brave young men to serve under me, and
we were well paid and kindly treated.</p>

<p>"The army of the Duke of Bourbon having already
appeared before the walls of Rome, Alessandro del Bene
requested that I would go with him to oppose the enemy.
I complied, and, taking one of the stoutest youths with
us,&mdash;we were afterwards joined by another,&mdash;we came
up to the walls of Campo Santo, and there descried that
great army which was employing every effort to enter the
town at that part of the wall to which we had approached.
Many young men were slain without the walls, where
they fought with the utmost fury; there was a remarkably
thick mist.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Levelling my arquebuse where I saw the thickest
crowd of the enemy, I discharged it with a deliberate aim
at a person who seemed to be lifted above the rest;
but the mist prevented me from distinguishing whether
he were on horseback or on foot. I then cautiously
approached the walls, and perceived that there was an
extraordinary confusion among the assailants, occasioned
by our having shot the Duke of Bourbon; he was, as
I understood afterwards, that chief personage whom I
saw raised above the rest."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Pope was induced by an enemy of Benvenuto, the
Cardinal Salviati, to send for a rival goldsmith, Tobbia, to
come to Rome. On his arrival both were summoned into
the Pope's presence.</p>

<p>"He then commanded each of us to draw a design for
setting a unicorn's horn, the most beautiful that ever was
seen, which had cost 17,000 ducats. As the Pope proposed
making a present of it to King Francis, he chose to
have it first richly adorned with gold; so he employed us
to draw the designs. When we had finished them we carried
them to the Pope. Tobbia's design was in the form
of a candlestick; the horn was to enter it like a candle,
and at the bottom of the candlestick he had represented
four little unicorns' heads,&mdash;a most simple invention.
As soon as I saw it, I could not contain myself so as to
avoid smiling at the oddity of the conceit. The Pope,
perceiving this, said, 'Let me see that design of yours.'
It was the single head of a unicorn, fitted to receive the
horn. I had made the most beautiful sort of head conceivable,
for I drew it partly in the form of a horse's head,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
and partly in that of a hart's, adorned with the finest sort
of wreaths and other devices; so that no sooner was my
design seen but the whole Court gave it the preference."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Benvenuto continued to make many beautiful things
for Pope Clement VII. up to the time of his death.
That Pope was succeeded in the papal chair by Cardinal
Farnese (Paul III.), on the 13th of October, 1534.</p>

<p>"I had formed a resolution to set out for France, as well
because I perceived that the Pope's favor was withdrawn
from me by means of slanderers who misrepresented my
services, as for fear that those of my enemies who had
most influence might still do me some greater injury. For
these reasons I was desirous to remove to some other
country, and see whether fortune would there prove more
favorable to me. Leaving Rome, I bent my course to
Florence, whence I travelled on to Bologna, Venice, and
Padua."</p>

<p>He reached Paris, with two workmen whom he took
with him from Rome, "without meeting any ill accident,
and travelling on in uninterrupted mirth." But being dissatisfied
with his reception there, he returned instantly to
Rome, where his fears were realized; for he was arrested
by order of the Pope, and made a prisoner in the Castle
of St. Angelo.</p>

<p>"This was the first time I ever knew the inside of a
prison, and I was then in my thirty-seventh year. The
constable of the Castle of St. Angelo was a countryman of
mine, a Florentine, named Signor Giorgio Ugolini. This
worthy gentleman behaved to me with the greatest politeness,
permitting me to walk freely about the castle on my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
parole of honor, and for no other reason but because he
saw the severity and injustice of my treatment.</p>

<p>"Finding I had been treated with so much rigor in
the affair, I began to think seriously about my escape.
I got my servants to bring me new thick sheets, and did
not send back the dirty ones. Upon their asking me for
them, I answered that I had given them away to some of
the poor soldiers. I pulled all the straw out of the tick of
my bed, and burned it; for I had a chimney in the room
where I lay. I then cut those sheets into a number of
slips each about one third of a cubit in width; and when
I thought I had made a sufficient quantity to reach from
the top to the bottom of the lofty tower of the Castle of St.
Angelo, I told my servants that I had given away as much
of my linen as I thought proper, and desired they would
take care to bring me clean sheets, adding that I would
constantly return the dirty ones.</p>

<p>"The constable of the castle had annually a certain
disorder which totally deprived him of his senses; and
when the fit came upon him, he was talkative to excess.
Every year he had some different whim: one time he
fancied himself metamorphosed into a pitcher of oil; another
time he thought himself a frog, and began to leap
as such; another time he imagined he was dead, and it
was found necessary to humor his conceit by making a
show of burying him; thus he had every year some new
frenzy. This year he fancied himself a bat, and when he
went to take a walk, he sometimes made just such a noise
as bats do; he likewise used gestures with his hands and
body, as if he were going to fly. His physicians and his
old servants, who knew his disorder, procured him all the
pleasures and amusements they could think of, and as
they found he delighted greatly in my conversation, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
frequently came to me to conduct me to his apartment,
where the poor man often detained me three or four hours
chatting with him.</p>

<p>"He asked me whether I had ever had a fancy to fly.
I answered that I had always been very ready to attempt
such things as men found most difficult; and that with
regard to flying, as God had given me a body admirably
well calculated for running, I had even resolution enough
to attempt to fly. He then proposed to me to explain
how I could contrive it. I replied that when I attentively
considered the several creatures that fly, and thought of
effecting by art what they do by the force of nature, I did
not find one so fit to imitate as the bat. As soon as the
poor man heard mention made of a bat, he cried out aloud,
'It is very true! a bat is the thing.' He then addressed
himself to me, and said, 'Benvenuto, if you had the opportunity,
would you have the heart to make an attempt to
fly?' I answered that if he would give me leave, I had
courage enough to attempt to fly by means of a pair of
wings waxed over. He said thereupon, 'I should like to
see you fly; but as the Pope has enjoined me to watch
over you with the utmost care, I am resolved to keep you
locked up with a hundred keys, that you may not slip out
of my hands.' I said, before all present, 'Confine me as
close as you please, I will contrive to make my escape,
notwithstanding.'"</p>

<p>At night, with a pair of pincers which he had secured,
he removed the nails which fastened the plates of iron fixed
upon the door, imitating with wax the heads of the nails
he took out, so that their absence need not be seen.</p>

<p>"One holiday evening, the constable being very much
disordered, he scarce said anything else but that he was
become a bat, and desired his people that if Benvenuto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
should happen to escape, they should take no notice of it,
for he must soon catch me, as he should doubtless be
better able to fly by night than I; adding, 'Benvenuto is
only a counterfeit bat, but I am a bat in real earnest.'</p>

<p>"As I had formed a resolution to attempt my escape
that night, I began by praying fervently to Almighty God
that it would please him to assist me in the enterprise.
Two hours before daybreak, I took the iron plates from
the door with great trouble. I at last forced the door, and
having taken with me my slips of linen, which I had rolled
up in bundles with the utmost care, I went out and got
upon the right side of the tower, and leaped upon two tiles
of the roof with the greatest ease. I was in a white
doublet, and had on a pair of white half-hose, over which
I wore a pair of little light boots, that reached half-way
up my legs, and in one of these I put my dagger. I then
took the end of one of my bundles of long slips, which I
had made out of the sheets of my bed, and fastened it to
one of the tiles of the roof that happened to jut out.
Then letting myself down gently, the whole weight of my
body being sustained by my arm, I reached the ground.
It was not a moonlight night, but the stars shone with
resplendent lustre. When I had touched the ground, I
first contemplated the great height which I had descended
with so much courage, and then walked away in high joy,
thinking I had recovered my liberty. But I soon found
myself mistaken, for the constable had caused two pretty
high walls to be erected on that side. I managed to fix
a long pole against the first wall, and by the strength of
my arms to climb to the top of it. I then fastened my
other string of slips, and descended down the steep wall.</p>

<p>"There was still another one; and in letting myself down,
being unable to hold out any longer, I fell, and, striking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
my head, became quite insensible. I continued in that
state about an hour and a half, as nearly as I can guess.
The day beginning to break, the cool breeze that precedes
the rising of the sun brought me to my senses;
but I conceived a strange notion that I had been beheaded,
and was then in purgatory. I recovered by
degrees my strength and powers, and, perceiving that
I had got out of the castle, I soon recollected all that
had befallen me. Upon attempting to rise from the
ground, I found that my right leg was broken, three
inches above the heel, which threw me into a terrible consternation.
Cutting with my dagger the part of my string
of slips I had left, I bandaged my leg as well as I could.
I then crept on my hands and knees towards the gate with
my dagger in my hand, and effected my egress. It was
about five hundred paces from the place where I had
had my fall to the gate by which I entered the city. It
was then broad daylight. As I happened to meet with a
water-carrier, who had loaded his ass, and filled his vessels
with water, I called to him, and begged he would put
me upon the beast's back, and carry me to the landing-place
of the steps of St. Peter's Church. I offered to give
him a gold crown, and, so saying, I clapped my hand
upon my purse, which was very well lined. The honest
waterman instantly took me upon his back, and carried
me to the steps before St. Peter's Church, where I desired
him to leave me and run back to his ass.</p>

<p>"Whilst I was crawling along upon all four, one of the
servants of Cardinal Cornaro knew me, and, running immediately
to his master's apartment, awakened him out of
his sleep, saying to him, 'My most reverend Lord, here is
your jeweller, Benvenuto, who has made his escape out
of the castle, and is crawling along upon all four, quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
besmeared with blood.' The cardinal, the moment he
heard this, said to his servants, 'Run, and bring him
hither to my apartment upon your backs.' When I came
into his presence the good cardinal bade me fear nothing,
and immediately sent for an excellent surgeon, who set
the bone, bandaged my leg, and bled me. The cardinal
then caused me to be put into a private apartment, and
went directly to the Vatican, in order to intercede in my
behalf with the Pope.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile the report of my escape made a great
noise all over Rome; for the long string of sheeting
fastened to the top of the lofty tower of the castle had
excited attention, and the inhabitants ran in crowds to
behold the sight. By this time the frenzy of the constable
had reached its highest pitch; he wanted, in spite
of all his servants, to fly from the same tower himself,
declaring there was but one way to retake me, and
that was to fly after me. He caused himself to be carried
into the presence of his Holiness, and began a terrible
outcry, saying that I had promised him, upon my
honor, that I would not fly away, and had flown away
notwithstanding."</p>

<p>The Cardinal Cornaro, however, and others interceded
for Benvenuto with the Pope, on account of his courage,
and the extraordinary efforts of his ingenuity, which
seemed to surpass human capacity. The Pope said he
had intended to keep him near his person, and to prevent
him from returning to France, adding, "I am concerned
to hear of his sufferings, however. Bid him take care of
his health; and when he is thoroughly recovered, it shall
be my study to make him some amends for his past
troubles." He was visited by young and old, persons of
all ranks.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>
<p>After this, Benvenuto went once more to France, where
he was received with high consideration by Francis I.,
who gave him, for his home and workshop in Paris, a
large old castle called the Nesle, of a triangular form,
close to the walls of the city. Here, with workmen
brought with him from Italy, he began many great works.</p>

<p>"Being thus become a favorite of the king, I was universally
admired. As soon as I had received silver to
make it of, I began to work on the statue of Jupiter, and
took into my service several journeymen. We worked
day and night with the utmost assiduity, insomuch that,
having finished Jupiter, Vulcan, and Mars in earth, and
Jupiter being pretty forward in silver, my shop began to
make a grand show. Just about this time the king made
his appearance at Paris, and I went to pay my respects to
him. When his Majesty saw me, he called to me in high
spirits, and asked me whether I had anything curious to
show him at my shop, for he intended to call there. I
told him of all I had done, and he expressed an earnest
desire to see my performances; and after dinner that day,
all the nobility belonging to the Court of France repaired
to my shop.</p>

<p>"I had just come home, and was beginning to work, when
the king made his appearance at my castle gate. Upon
hearing the sound of so many hammers, he commanded
his retinue to be silent. All my people were at work, so
that the king came upon us quite unexpectedly. As he
entered the saloon, the first object he perceived was myself
with a large piece of plate in my hand, which was to
make the body of Jupiter; another was employed on the
head, another again on the legs, so that the shop resounded
with the beating of hammers. His Majesty was
highly pleased, and returned to his palace, after having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>conferred so many favors on me that it would be tedious
to enumerate them.</p>

<p>"Having with the utmost diligence finished the beautiful
statue of Jupiter, with its gilt pedestal, I placed it
upon a wooden socle, which scarce made any appearance,
and within that socle I fixed four little globes of wood,
which were more than half hidden in their sockets, and so
contrived that a little child could with the utmost ease
move this statue of Jupiter backwards and forwards, and
turn it about. I took it with me to Fontainebleau, where
the King then resided. I was told to put it in the gallery,&mdash;a
place which might be called a corridor, about two
hundred paces long, adorned and enriched with pictures
and pieces of sculpture, amongst them some of the finest
imitations of the antique statues of Rome. Here also I
introduced my Jupiter; and when I saw this great display
of the wonders of art, I said to myself, 'This is like passing
between the pikes of the enemy; Heaven protect me
from all danger!'</p>

<p>"This figure of Jupiter had a thunderbolt in his right
hand, and by his attitude seemed to be just going to
throw it; in his left I had placed a globe, and amongst
the flames I had with great dexterity put a piece of white
torch. On the approach of night I lighted the torch in
the hand of Jupiter; and as it was raised somewhat above
his head, the light fell upon the statue, and caused it to appear
to much greater advantage than it would otherwise have
done. When I saw his Majesty enter with several great
lords and noblemen, I ordered my boy to push the statue
before him, and this motion, being made with admirable
contrivance, caused it to appear alive; thus the other figures
in the gallery were left somewhat behind, and the eyes
of all the beholders were first struck with my performance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"The king immediately cried out: 'This is one of the
finest productions of art that ever was beheld. I, who take
pleasure in such things and understand them, could never
have conceived a piece of work the hundredth part so
beautiful!'"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Cellini, however, who was exacting and sensitive, became
dissatisfied with the treatment of the King of
France; and, leaving his workmen at his tower of the
Nesle, he returned to Italy, and engaged in the service of
Cosmo de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, who assigned
him a house to work in.</p>

<p>His chief performance here was a bronze statue of
Perseus for the fine square before the Palazzo Vecchio.
After many drawbacks, doubts, and difficulties,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I now took courage, resolving to depend on myself,
and banished all those thoughts which from time to time
occasioned me great inquietude, and made me sorely repent
my ever having quitted France. I still flattered myself
that if I could but finish my statue of Perseus, all
my labors would be converted to delight, and meet with
a glorious and happy reward.</p>

<p>"This statue was intended to be of bronze, five ells
in height, of one piece, and hollow. I first formed my
model of clay, more slender than the statue was intended
to be. I then baked it, and covered it with wax of the
thickness of a finger, which I modelled into the perfect
form of the statue. In order to effect in concave what
the wax represented in convex, I covered the wax with
clay, and baked this second covering. Thus, the wax
dissolving, and escaping by fissures left open for the purpose,
I obtained, between the first model and the second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
covering, a space for the introduction of the metal. In
order to introduce the bronze without moving the first
model, I placed the model in a pit dug under the furnace,
and by means of pipes and apertures in the model itself,
I meant to introduce the liquid metal.</p>

<p>"After I had made its coat of earth, covered it well, and
bound it properly with irons, I began by means of a slow
fire to draw off the wax, which melted away by many
vent-holes,&mdash;for the more of these are made, the better
the moulds are filled; and when I had entirely stripped
off the wax, I made a sort of fence round my Perseus,
that is, round the mould, of bricks, piling them one upon
another, and leaving several vacuities for the fire to exhale
at. I next began gradually to put on the wood, and kept
a constant fire for two days and two nights, till, the wax
being quite off and the mould well baked, I began to dig
a hole to bury my mould in, and observed all those fine
methods of proceeding that are proscribed by our art.
When I had completely dug my hole, I took my mould,
and by means of levers and strong cables directed it with
care, and suspended it a cubit above the level of the
furnace, so that it hung exactly in the middle of the hole.
I then let it gently down to the very bottom of the
furnace, and placed it with all the care and exactness I
possibly could. After I had finished this part of my task
I began to make a covering of the very earth I had taken
off; and in proportion as I raised the earth, I made vents
for it, of a sort of tubes of baked earth, generally used for
conduits, and other things of a similar nature.</p>

<p>"I had caused my furnace to be filled with several
pieces of brass and bronze, and heaped them upon one
another in the manner taught us by our art, taking particular
care to leave a passage for the flames, that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
metal might the sooner assume its color, and dissolve into
a fluid. Thus, with great alacrity, I excited my men to
lay on the pine-wood, which, because of the oiliness of
the resinous matter that oozes from the pine-tree and that
my furnace was admirably well made, burned at such a
rate that I was continually obliged to run to and fro,
which greatly fatigued me. I, however, bore the hardship;
but, to add to my misfortune, the shop took fire,
and we were all very much afraid that the roof would fall
in and crush us. From another quarter, that is, from the
garden, the sky poured in so much rain and wind that
it cooled my furnace.</p>

<p>"Thus did I continue to struggle with these cross accidents
for several hours, and exerted myself to such a
degree that my constitution, though robust, could no
longer bear such severe hardship, and I was suddenly
attacked by a most violent intermitting fever; in short,
I was so ill that I found myself under a necessity of lying
down upon my bed. This gave me great concern, but
it was unavoidable. I thereupon addressed myself to
my assistants, who were about ten in number, saying
to them: 'Be careful to observe the method which I have
shown you, and use all possible expedition; for the metal
will soon be ready. You cannot mistake; these two
worthy men here will quickly make the orifices. With two
such directors you can certainly contrive to pour out the
hot metal, and I have no doubt but my mould will be
filled completely. I find myself extremely ill, and really
believe that in a few hours this severe disorder will put
an end to my life.' Thus I left them in great sorrow,
and went to bed. I then ordered the maids to carry
victuals and drink into the shop for all the men, and told
them I did not expect to live till the next morning. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
this manner did I continue for two hours in a violent
fever, which I every moment perceived to increase, and
I was incessantly crying out, 'I am dying, I am dying.'</p>

<p>"My housekeeper was one of the most sensible and
affectionate women in the world. She rebuked me for
giving way to vain fears, and at the same time attended
me with the greatest kindness and care imaginable; however,
seeing me so very ill, and terrified to such a degree,
she could not contain herself, but shed a flood of tears,
which she endeavored to conceal from me. Whilst we
were both in this deep affliction, I perceived a man enter
the room, who in his person appeared to be as crooked
and distorted as a great S, and began to express himself
in these terms, in a dismal and melancholy voice: 'Alas,
poor Benvenuto, your work is spoiled, and the misfortune
admits of no remedy.'</p>

<p>"No sooner had I heard the words uttered by this
messenger of evil, but I cried out so loud that my voice
might be heard to the skies, and got out of bed. I
began immediately to dress, and, giving plenty of kicks
and cuffs to the maidservants and the boy as they offered
to help me on with my clothes, I complained bitterly
in these terms: 'Oh, you envious and treacherous
wretches, this is a piece of villany contrived on purpose;
but I will sift it to the bottom, and before I die give such
proofs who I am as shall not fail to astonish the whole
world.' Having huddled on my clothes, I went, with a
mind boding evil, to the shop, where I found all those
whom I had left so alert and in such high spirits, standing
in the utmost confusion and astonishment. I thereupon
addressed them thus: 'Listen, all of you, to what
I am going to say; and since you either would not or
could not follow the method I pointed out, obey me now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
that I am present. My work is before us; and let none
of you offer to oppose or contradict me, for such cases
as this require activity and not counsel.' Hereupon one
of them had the assurance to say to me, 'Look you,
Benvenuto, you have undertaken a work which our art
cannot compass, and which is not to be effected by
human power.'</p>

<p>"Hearing these words, I turned round in such a passion,
and seemed so bent upon mischief, that both he and
all the rest unanimously cried out to me, 'Give your orders,
and we will all second you in whatever you command; we
will assist you as long as we have breath in our bodies.'
These kind and affectionate words they uttered, as I
firmly believe, in a persuasion that I was upon the point
of expiring. I went directly to examine the furnace, and
saw all the metal in it concreted. I thereupon ordered
two of the helpers to step over the way to a butcher for
a load of young oak which had been above a year drying,
which had been already offered to me.</p>

<p>"Upon his bringing me the first bundles of it, I began
to fill the grate. This sort of oak makes a brisker fire
than any other wood whatever; but the wood of elder-trees
and pine-trees is used in casting artillery, because
it makes a mild and gentle fire. As soon as the concreted
metal felt the power of this violent fire, it began
to brighten and glitter. In another quarter I made them
hurry the tubes with all possible expedition, and sent
some of them to the roof of the house to take care of the
fire, which through the great violence of the wind had
acquired new force; and towards the garden I had caused
some tables with pieces of tapestry and old clothes to be
placed in order to shelter me from the rain. As soon as
I had applied the proper remedy to each evil, I with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
loud voice cried out to my men to bestir themselves and
lend a helping hand; so that when they saw that the concreted
metal began to melt again, the whole body obeyed
me with such zeal and alacrity that every man did the
work of three. Then I caused a mass of pewter weighing
about sixty pounds to be thrown upon the metal in the
furnace, which, with the other helps, as the brisk wood-fire,
and stirring it sometimes with iron and sometimes
with long poles, soon became completely dissolved.
Finding that, contrary to the opinion of my ignorant
assistants, I had effected what seemed as difficult to
raise as the dead, I recovered my vigor to such a degree
that I no longer perceived whether I had any fever, nor
had I the least apprehension of death.</p>

<p>"Suddenly a loud noise was heard, and a glittering
of fire flashed before our eyes, as if it had been the darting
of a thunderbolt. Upon the appearance of this extraordinary
phenomenon terror seized upon all present,
and none more than myself. This tremendous noise
being over, we began to stare at each other, and perceived
that the cover of the furnace had burst and flown
off, so that the bronze began to run.</p>

<p>"I immediately caused the mouths of my mould to be
opened; but, finding that the metal did not run with its
usual velocity, and apprehending that the cause of it was
that the fusibility of the metal was injured by the violence
of the fire, I ordered all my dishes and porringers,
which were in number about two hundred, to be placed
one by one before my tubes, and part of them to be
thrown into the furnace; upon which all present perceived
that my mould was filling: they now with joy and
alacrity assisted and obeyed me. I, for my part, was
sometimes in one place, sometimes in another, giving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
my directions and assisting my men, before whom I offered
up this prayer: 'O God, I address myself to thee.
I acknowledge in gratitude this mercy, that my mould
has been filled. I fall prostrate before thee, and with my
whole heart return thanks to thy divine majesty.'</p>

<p>"My prayer being over, I took a plate of meat which
stood upon a little bench, and ate with a great appetite.
I then drank with all my journeymen and assistants, and
went joyful and in good health to bed; for there were still
two hours of night, and I rested as well as if I had been
troubled with no disorder.</p>

<p>"My good housekeeper, without my having given any
orders, had provided a good capon for my dinner. When
I arose, which was not till about noon, she accosted me in
high spirits, and said merrily, 'Is this the man that thought
himself dying? It is my firm belief that the cuffs and
kicks you gave us last night when you were quite frantic
and possessed, frightened away your fever, which, apprehending
you should fall upon it in the same manner, took
to flight.' So my whole poor family, having got over such
panics and hardships, without delay procured earthen vessels
to supply the place of the pewter dishes and porringers,
and we all dined together very cheerfully; indeed,
I do not remember having ever in my life eaten a meal
with greater satisfaction or a better appetite. After dinner,
all those who had assisted me in my work came and
congratulated me upon what had happened, returned
thanks to the Divine Being for having interposed so mercifully
in our behalf, and declared that they had in theory and
practice learnt such things as were judged impossible by
other masters. I thereupon thought it allowable to boast a
little of my knowledge and skill in this fine art, and, pulling
out my purse, satisfied all my workmen for their labor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Having left my work to cool during two days after it
was cast, I began gradually to uncover it. I first of all
found the Medusa's head, which had come out admirably
by the assistance of the vents. I proceeded to uncover
the rest, and found that the other head&mdash;I mean that of
Perseus&mdash;was likewise come out perfectly well. I went
on uncovering it with great success, and found every part
turn out to admiration, till I reached the foot of the
right leg, which supports the figure. I found that not only
the toes were wanting, but part of the foot itself, so that
there was almost one half deficient. This occasioned me
some new trouble; but I was not displeased at it, as I
had expected this very thing.</p>

<p>"It pleased God that as soon as ever my work, although
still unfinished, was seen by the populace, they set up so
loud a shout of applause, that I began to be somewhat
comforted for the mortifications I had undergone; and
there were sonnets in my praise every day upon the gate,
the language of which was extremely elegant and poetical.
The very day on which I exhibited my work, there were
above twenty sonnets set up, containing the most hyperbolical
praises of it. Even after I had covered it again,
every day a number of verses, with Latin odes and Greek
poems, were published on the occasion,&mdash;for it was then
vacation at the University of Pisa, and all the learned men
and scholars belonging to that place vied with each other
in writing encomiums on my performance. But what gave
me the highest satisfaction was that even those of the profession&mdash;I
mean statuaries and painters&mdash;emulated each
other in commending me. In fact, I was so highly praised,
and in so elegant a style, that it afforded me some alleviation
for my past mortification and troubles, and I made
all the haste I could to put the last hand to my statue.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"At last, as it pleased the Almighty, I completely finished
my work, and on a Thursday morning exhibited it
fully. Just before the break of day so great a crowd gathered
about it, that it is almost impossible for me to give
the reader an idea of their number; and they all seemed
to vie with each other who should praise it most. The
duke stood at a lower window of the palace, just over the
gate, and, being half concealed within side, heard all that
was said concerning the work. After he had listened several
hours, he left the window highly pleased, and sent
me this message: 'Go to Benvenuto, and tell him from
me that he has given me higher satisfaction than I ever
expected. Let him know at the same time that I shall
reward him in such a manner as will excite his surprise.'"</p>

<p>The manuscript of Benvenuto's Life is not carried much
farther. The narrative breaks off abruptly in 1562, when
Cellini was in the sixty-second year of his age. He does
not appear from this time to have been engaged in any
work of much importance. After the execution of his
grand achievement of the Perseus, the narrative of his life
seems to have been the most successful of all the labors
of his declining years.</p>

<p>On the 15th day of February, 1570, this extraordinary
man died. He was buried, by his own direction, with great
funeral pomp. A monk who had been charged to compose
the funeral sermon, in praise both of his life and
works and of his excellent moral qualities, mounted the
pulpit and delivered a discourse which was highly approved
by the whole academy and by the people. They struggled
to enter the chapter, as well to see the body of Benvenuto
as to hear the commendation of his good qualities.</p>

<small>BERNARD PALISSY.</small></h2>


<p>Two or three of the girls had dabbled a little in painting
on porcelain, and several of them had become interested
in various sorts of pottery. Mabel had been at
Newburyport, on a visit with some friends who had a potter's
wheel of their own; and she had turned for herself,
and had had baked, some vases and dishes which she
had brought home with her.</p>

<p>This tempted them all to make a party, in which several
of the boys joined, to go to the Art Museum and see
the exquisite pottery there, of different sorts, ancient and
modern. There they met one of the gentlemen of a
large firm of dealers in keramics; and he asked them to
go through their magnificent establishment, and see the
collection, which is one of great beauty. It shows several
of the finest styles of manufacture in very choice
specimens.</p>

<p>This prepared them to see Japanese work. And when
Uncle Fritz heard of this, he asked Professor Morse, of
Salem, if he would show them his marvellous collection of
Japanese pottery. Professor Morse lived in Japan under
very favorable auspices, and he made there a wonderful
collection of the work of the very best artists. So five or
six of the young people went down to Salem, at his very
kind invitation, and saw there what is one of the finest
collections in the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>All this interested them in what now receives a great
deal of attention, the manufacture and ornament of pottery.
The word <i>keramics</i> is a word recently added to the
English language to express the art of making pottery and
of ornamenting it.</p>

<p>When Uncle Fritz found that they really wanted to
know about such things, he arranged that for one afternoon
they should read about</p>


<h3>BERNARD PALISSY THE POTTER.</h3>

<p>Bernard Palissy was born, about 1510, in the little town
of Biron, in P&eacute;rigord, France. He became not only a
great artist, but a learned physician, and a writer of merit.</p>

<p>Born of poor parents of the working-class, he had to
learn some trade, and early applied himself to working
glass, not as a glazier, but staining it and cutting it up in
little bits, to be joined together with lead for the colored
windows so much used in churches. This was purely
mechanical work; but Bernard's ambition led him to study
drawing and color, that he might himself design and
execute, in glass, scenes from the Bible and lives of the
saints, such as he saw done by his superiors.</p>

<p>When he was old enough, curious to see the world and
learn new things, he took a journey on foot through several
provinces of France, by observation thus supplying the
defects of his early education, and reaping a rich harvest
of facts and ideas, which developed the qualities of his
intelligence.</p>

<p>It was at this time that the Renaissance in Art was making
itself felt throughout Europe. Francis I. of France
encouraged all forms of good work by his patronage;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
and wherever he went the young Palissy was animated
and inspired by the sight of beautiful things.</p>

<p><i>Faience</i>, an elegant kind of pottery, attracted his attention.
This appeared first in the fourteenth century. The
Arabs had long known the art of making tiles of clay,
enamelled and richly ornamented. They brought it into
Spain, as is shown in the decorations of the Alhambra at
Seville and elsewhere. Lucca della Robbia in Italy first
brought the art to perfection, by making figures and
groups of figures in high relief, of baked clay covered
with shining enamel, white, tinted with various colors.
The kind of work called <i>majolica</i> differed from the earlier
faience by some changes in the material used for the
enamel. In the middle of the sixteenth century remarkable
historical paintings were executed in faience, upon
huge <i>plaques</i>. All the cities of Italy vied with each other
in producing wonders in this sort of work; it is from one
of them, Faenza, that it takes its name. The method
of making the enamel was a deep secret; but Bernard
Palissy, with long patience and after many failures, succeeded
in discovering it,&mdash;or, rather, in inventing for
himself a new method, which in some respects excelled
the old.</p>

<p>Palissy was the author of several essays, or "Discourses;"
and from one of these, written in quaint old
French, we have his own account of his invention.</p>

<p>He married and settled down in the year 1539 with
a good income from his intelligent industry. He had a
pleasant little house in the country, where, as he says, "I
could rejoice in the sight of green hills, where were feeding
and gambolling lambs, sheep, and goats."</p>

<p>An incident, apparently slight, disturbed this placid domestic
happiness. He came across a cup of enamelled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
pottery, doubtless from Italy. "This cup," he says, "was
of such beauty, that, from the moment I saw it, I entered
into a dispute with myself as to how it could have been
made."</p>

<p>Enamel is nothing more than a kind of glaze colored
with metallic acids, and rendered opaque by the mixture
of a certain quantity of tin. It is usually spread upon
metal, when only it is properly called enamel; but this
glaze can also be put upon earthenware. It makes
vessels water-tight, and gives them brilliancy of surface.
To find out how to do this was to make a revolution in
the keramic art.</p>

<p>In France, in the sixteenth century, the only vessels,
such as jugs or vases, were made either of metal, wood,
or coarse porous pottery, through which water could penetrate;
like the goulehs of the Arabs, or the cantaras of the
Moors, which are still used for fresh water to advantage,
since the evaporation of the drops keeps the water cold.</p>

<p>Many attempts had been made to imitate the beautiful
and costly vases of China; but no one succeeded until the
potters of Italy found out how to make faience. The
discovery was hailed as a most valuable one. The princes
who owned the works guarded their secret with jealous
care,&mdash;to betray it would have been punished by death;
so that Bernard Palissy had no hope of being taught how
it was done, even if he should go to the places in Italy
where the work was carried on.</p>

<p>"But," he says, "what others had found out, I might
also discover; and if I could once make myself master of
the art of glazing, I felt sure I could elevate pottery to a
degree of perfection as yet unknown. What a glory for
my name, what a benefit to France, if I could establish
this industry here in my own land!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>He turned and turned the cup in his fingers, admiring
the brilliant surface. "Yes," he said at last; "it shall be
so, for I choose! I have already studied the subject.
I will work still harder, and reach my aim at last."</p>

<p>Exceptional determination of character was needed for
such an object. Palissy knew nothing about the component
parts of enamels; he had never even seen the process
of baking clay, and he had to begin with the very
simplest investigations. To study the different kinds of
earth and clay, to acquire the arts of moulding and turning,
and to gain some knowledge of chemistry, all these
were necessary. But he did not flinch, and pursued his
idea with indomitable perseverance.</p>

<p>"Moving only by chance," he says, "like a man groping
in the dark, I made a collection of all the different
substances which seemed at all likely to make enamel,
and I pounded them up fine; then I bought earthen
pots, broke them into small bits, numbered these pieces,
and spread over each of them a different combination of
materials. Now I had to have a furnace in which to bake
my experiments. I had no idea how furnaces were usually
made; so I invented one of my own, and set it up.
But I had no idea how much heat was required to melt
enamels,&mdash;perhaps I heated my furnace too much, perhaps
not enough; sometimes my ingredients were all
burned up, sometimes they melted not at all; or else some
were turned to coal, while others remained undisturbed
by the action of the fire."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the resources of the unlucky workman were
fast diminishing; for he had abandoned his usual work, by
which he earned his living, and kept making new furnaces,
"with great expense and trouble, and a great consumption
of time and firewood."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>This state of affairs much displeased his wife, who complained
bitterly, and tried to divert her husband from an
occupation which earned for him nothing but disappointment.
The cheerful little household changed its aspect;
the children were no longer well-dressed, and the shabby
furniture and empty cupboards betrayed the decay which
was falling upon the family. The father saw with profound
grief the wants of his household; but success
seemed ever so near to him, that he could not bear to give
it up. His hope at that time was but a mirage; and for
long afterwards, in this struggle between intelligence and
the antagonism of material things, ill fortune kept the
upper hand.</p>

<p>One day, tired out by his failures, it occurred to him
that a man brought up to baking pottery would know
how to bake his specimens better than he could.</p>

<p>"I covered three or four hundred bits of broken vase
with different compounds, and sent them to a <i>fabrique</i>
about a mile and a half from my house. The potters
consented to put my patterns with their batch for the oven.
Full of impatience, I awaited the result of this experiment.
I was on hand when my specimens came out. I
looked them anxiously all over; not one was successful!</p>

<p>"The heat had not been strong enough, but I did not
know this; I saw only one more useless expense of
money. One of the workmen came to me and said, 'You
will never make anything out of this; you had better go
back to your own business.'"</p>

<p>Palissy shook his head; he had still in his possession
some few valuable articles, souvenirs of happier days,
which he could sell to renew his experiments. In spite
of the reproaches of his wife, he bought more ingredients
and more earthenware, and made new combinations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>Failure again! However, he would not be beaten.
Some friends lent him a little money; he sat up at night
to make new mixtures of different substances, all prepared
with such care that he felt sure some of them must be
good. Then he carried them again to the potters, whom
he urged to the greatest care. They only shrugged their
shoulders, and called him "crack brain;" and when the
batch was done, they brought the results to Palissy with
jeers. Some of the pieces were dirty white; others green,
red, or smoked by the fire; but all alike in being dull
and worthless.</p>

<p>It was over. Discouragement took possession of Palissy.
"I returned home," he says, "full of confusion
and sadness. Others might seek the secret of enamels.
I must set to work and earn money to pay my debts
and get bread for the family."</p>

<p>Most luckily for him at this time, a task was given him
by government, for which he was well suited, and which
brought him good pay. The king, Francis I., having
had, like many another sovereign, some difficulty with his
faithful subjects in the matter of imposts, now found it
necessary to make a new regulation of taxes; and for this,
among other things, an inspection of the salt marshes on
the coasts of France was needed, in order to name the
right sums for taxation, and a knowledge of arithmetic
was required as well. Palissy was appointed; and to the
great delight of his family, who thought that his mind
would now be forever diverted from the search for enamel,
he set forth to explore the islands and the shores of France.
He drew admirable outlines of the forms of the salt marshes,
and wrote with eloquence upon the sublimity of the sea.</p>

<p>Ease and comfort came back. His task was ended;
but debts were paid, and plenty of money remained.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>The first thing he saw on returning home, alas! was the
cup,&mdash;his joy and despair. "How beautiful it is! how
brilliant!" he exclaimed; and once more he threw himself
into the pursuit of the elusive enamel.</p>

<p>It was easy to see that the so much admired faience of
Italy was simply common baked clay, covered with some
substance glazed by heat, but so composed as to adhere
to the surface after it had cooled. But what substance?
He had tried all sorts of materials; why had none of
them melted? Palissy at length decided that the fault
had been in using the common potter's furnace. Since
the materials were to be vitrified by the process, they
should be baked like glass. He broke up three dozen
pots, pounded up a great quantity of different ingredients,
and spread them with a brush on the fragments; then he
carried them to the nearest glass-works. He was allowed
to superintend the baking himself; he put the specimens
in the oven, and passed the night attending the fire. In
the morning he took them out. "Oh, joy! Some of the
compounds had begun to melt; there was no perfect
glaze, only a sign that I was on the right road."</p>

<p>It was, however, still a long and weary one. After two
more years, Palissy was still far from the discovery of enamelling,
but during this time he was acquiring much
knowledge. From a simple workman he had become a
learned chemist. He says himself, "The mistakes I made
in combining my enamels taught me more than the things
which came right of themselves."</p>

<p>There came a time, which he had once more resolved
should be the last, when he repaired to the glass-works,
accompanied by a man loaded with more than three hundred
different patterns on bits of pottery. For four hours
Bernard gloomily watched the progress of baking. Sud<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>denly
he started in surprise. Did his eyes deceive him?
No! it was no illusion. One of the pieces in the furnace
was covered with a brilliant glazing, white, polished, excellent.
Palissy's joy was immense. "I thought I had
become a new creature," he says. "The enamel was
found; France enriched by a new discovery."</p>

<p>Palissy now hastened to undertake a whole vase. For
many and large pieces there was not room enough at his
disposition in the ovens of the glass-works. He did not
worry about that, for he was quite sure he could construct
one of his own. He decided, too, at once to
model and fashion his own vases; for those which he
bought of the potters, made of coarse and heavy forms,
no longer suited his ambition. He now designed forms,
turned and modelled them himself. Thus passed seven
or eight months. At last his vases were done, and he
admired with pride the pure forms given to the clay by
his hands. But his money was giving out again, and his
furnace was not yet built. As he had nothing to pay for
the work, he did all the work himself,&mdash;went after bricks
and brought them himself on his back, and then built and
plastered with his own hands. The neighbors looked on
in pity and ridicule. "Look," they said, "at Master
Bernard! He might live at his ease, and yet he makes
a beast of burden of himself!"</p>

<p>Palissy minded their sarcasms not at all. His furnace
was finished in good time, and the first baking of the clay
succeeded perfectly. Now the pottery was to be covered
with his new enamel. Time pressed, for in a few days
there would be no more bread in the house for his children.
For a long time he had been living on credit, but
now the butcher and baker refused to furnish anything
more. All about him he saw only unfriendly faces; every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
one treated him as a fool. "Let him die of hunger,"
they said, "since he will not listen to reason."</p>

<p>His wife was the worst of all. She failed to see any
heroism in the obstinacy or perseverance of her husband,&mdash;no
wonder, perhaps, with the sight of her suffering
children before her eyes. She went about reciting her
misfortunes to all the neighborhood, very unwisely, as she
thus ruined the credit of her husband, his last and only
resource.</p>

<p>Palissy was already worn out by so much manual labor,
to which he was little accustomed; nevertheless, he
worked by night, and all night long, to pound up and
prepare the materials for his white enamel, and to spread
it upon his vases. A report went abroad, caused by the
sight of his lamp constantly burning, that he was trying
to coin counterfeit money. He was suspected, despised,
and avoided, and went about the streets hanging his head
because he had no answer to make to his accusers.</p>

<p>The moment which was to decide his life arrived. The
vases were placed in the furnace, and for six continuous
days and nights he plied the glowing fire with fuel. The
heat was intolerable; but the enamel resisted, nothing
would melt, and he was forced to recognize that there
was too little of the glazing substance in the combination
to vitrify the others. He set to work to mix another
compound, but his vases were spoiled; he borrowed a
few common ones from the pottery. During all this
delay he did not dare to let the fire go out, it would take
so much wood to start it again. Once more the newly
covered pots were placed in the intense furnace; in three
or four hours the test would be completed. Palissy perceived
with terror that his fuel was giving out. He ran
to his garden, tore up fences, and cut down trees which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
he had planted himself, and threw all these into the two
yawning mouths of the furnace. Not enough! He went
into the house, and seized tables, chairs, and bureaus; but
the house was but poorly furnished, and contained but
little to feed the flames. Palissy returned. The rooms
were empty, there was absolutely nothing more to take;
then he fell to pulling up the planks of the floor. His
wife, frightened to death, stood still and let him go on.
The neighbors ran in, at the sound of the axe, and said,
"He must be a fool!"</p>

<p>But soon pity changed to admiration. When Palissy
took the vases from the furnace, the common pots which
all had seen before dull and coarse, were of a clear pearly
white, covered with brilliant polish.</p>

<p>So much emotion and fatigue had told upon the robust
constitution of Palissy. "I was," he says, "all used up
and dried up on account of such toil, and the heat of the
furnace. It was more than a month since I had had a
dry shirt on my body, and I felt as if I had reached the
door of the sepulchre."</p>

<p>In spite of the success which he had now attained, our
potter had by no means reached the end of his misfortunes.
He sold his vases, but could not get much for
them, as there were but a few, of poor shapes; for those
which he had modelled himself had all failed to take the
enamel, and the successful ones were only common things,
bought on credit. The small sum which he got by selling
them was not enough by any means to cover his expenses,
pay his debts, and restore order to the house from which
pretty much everything was burned up for firewood in
his furnace.</p>

<p>However, he was supported and happy in the thought
of his success. He said to himself: "Why be sad, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
you have found what you were seeking for? Go on
working, and you will put your enemies to shame."</p>

<p>Once more he succeeded in borrowing a little money.
He hired a man to help him; and for want of funds, he
paid this man by giving him all his own good clothes,
while he went himself in rags. The furnace he had made
was coming to pieces on account of the intense heat he
had maintained in it for six days and nights during his
last experiment. He pulled it to pieces with his own
hands, working with fingers bleeding and bound up in
bandages. Then he fetched water, sand, lime, and stone,
and built by himself a new furnace, "without any help or
any repose. A feverish resolution doubled my strength,
and made me capable of doing things which I should
have imagined impossible."</p>

<p>This time the oven heats admirably, the enamels appear
to be melting. Palissy goes to rest, and dreams of
his new vases, which must bring enough to pay all his
debts; his impatient creditors come in the morning to
see the things taken from the furnace. Palissy receives
them joyfully; he would like to invite the whole town.</p>

<p>When the pieces came out of the oven, they were
shining and beautiful; but&mdash;always but!&mdash;an accident
had deprived them of all value. Little stones, which
formed a part of the mortar with which the furnace was
built, had burst with the heat, and spattered the enamel
all over with sharp fragments cutting like a razor, entirely
spoiling it of course. Still, the vases were so lovely in
form, and the glaze was so beautiful, that several people
offered to buy them if they could have them cheap. This
the proud potter would not bear. Seizing the vases, he
dashed them to the ground; then utterly worn out, he
went into the house and threw himself on the bed. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
wife followed him, and covered him with reproaches for thus
wasting the chance of making a few francs for the family.
Soon he recovered his elasticity, reflecting "that a man
who has tumbled into a ditch has but one duty, and that
is to try to get out of it."</p>

<p>He now set to work at his old business of painting
upon glass, and after several months had earned enough
to start another batch of vases. Of these, two or three
were successful and sold to advantage; the rest were
spoiled by ashes which fell upon the enamel in the furnace
while it was soft. He therefore invented what he called
a "lantern" of baked clay, to put over the vases to protect
them in baking. This expedient proved so good
that it is still used.</p>

<p>The enamel once discovered, it would be supposed
that all trouble was over; but it is not enough to invent
a process,&mdash;to carry it out, all sorts of little things have
to be considered, the least of which, if not attended to, may
spoil all the rest. These multiplied accidents, with all the
privations and sufferings he had undergone, were attacking
the health of Palissy. He says in his simple style,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was so used up in my person, that there was no
shape or appearance of curve on my arms or legs; my so-called
legs, indeed, were but a straight line, so that when
I had gartered my stockings, as soon as I began to walk,
they were down on my heels."</p>

<p>His enamelled pottery now began to make a living for
its inventor, but so poor a living that many things were
wanting,&mdash;for instance, a suitable workshop. For five or
six years he carried on the work in the open air; either
heat, rain, or cold spoiled many of his vases, while he himself,
exposed to the weather, "passed whole nights at the
mercy of rain and cold, without any aid, comfort, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
companionship except that of owls screeching on one side
and dogs howling on the other. Sometimes," he continues,
"winds and tempests blew with such violence inside and
outside of my ovens, that I was obliged to leave, with a
total loss of all they contained. Several times when I had
thus left everything, without a dry rag upon me, on account
of the rain, I came in at midnight or daybreak without any
light, staggering like a drunken man, all broken down at
the thought of my wasted toil; and then, all wet and dirty
as I was, I found in my bedroom the worst affliction of
all, which makes me wonder now why I was not consumed
by grief." He means the scolding and reproaches of his
wife.</p>

<p>But the time came when his perseverance was rewarded,
and his pottery brought him the fame and money he deserved.
He was able to make new experiments, and add
to the value of his discovery. Having obtained the white
enamel, he had the idea of tinting it with all sorts of colors,
which he did successfully. He then began to decorate his
faience with objects modelled from nature, such as animals,
shells, leaves, and branches. Lizards of a bright emerald
color, with pointed heads and slender tails, and snakes
gliding between stones or curled upon a bank of moss,
crabs, frogs, and spiders, all of their natural colors, and
disposed in the midst of plants equally well imitated, are
the characteristic details of the work of Palissy.</p>

<p>These perfect imitations of Nature were taken actually
from Nature herself. Palissy prepared a group of real
leaves and stones, putting the little insects or animals he
wished to represent in natural attitudes amongst them.
He fastened these reptiles, fishes, or insects in their places
by fine threads, and then made a mould of the whole in
plaster of Paris. When it was done, he removed the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
animals from the mould so carefully that he could use
them over and over again.</p>

<p>Thus, after sixteen years passed in untiring energy, sixteen
years of anxiety and privation, the artist triumphed
over all the obstacles opposed to his genius. The humble
potter, despised of all, became the most important man in
his town. His productions were sought for eagerly, and
his reputation established forever.</p>

<p>His life henceforth was not free from events, but these
were not connected with his invention. His fame came to
the knowledge of the queen mother Catherine de M&eacute;dicis;
for Francis I. was no longer living, and Charles IX. had
succeeded Francis II. upon the throne. He was summoned
to Court, and employed to build grottos, decorated
with his designs, by personages of distinction,&mdash;one
especially for the queen herself, which he describes in his
Discourse of the "Jardin Delectable."</p>

<p>He was in Paris at the time of the terrible massacre of
St. Bartholomew, where, as he was a Huguenot, he would
doubtless have perished but for the protection of the
queen, who helped him to escape with his family.</p>

<p>Later, however, in the midst of the troubles and terrors
of the time, he was thrown into the Bastille; and there he
died, an old man of eighty years.</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI.<br /><br />

<small>BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.</small></h2>


<p>"We call the Americans a nation of inventors," said
Fergus. "How long has this been true?"</p>

<p>"That is a very curious question," said Uncle Fritz.
"You remember we were talking of it before. When I go
back to think of the hundred and fifty years before Bunker
Hill, I think there must have been a great many inglorious
Miltons hidden away in the New England towns. Really,
the arts advanced very little between 1630 and 1775.
Flint-locks had come in, instead of match-locks. But,
actually, the men at Bunker Hill rested over the rail-fence
old muskets which had been used in Queen Anne's time;
and to this day a 'Queen's arm' is a provincial phrase,
in New England, for one of these old weapons, not yet
forgotten. That inability to improve its own condition
comes to a people which lets another nation do its manufacturing
for it. You see much the same thing in Turkey
and French Canada. Just as soon as they were thrown
on their own resources here, they began to invent."</p>

<p>"But," said Fergus, "there was certainly one great
American inventor before that time."</p>

<p>"You mean Franklin,&mdash;the greatest American yet, I
suppose, if you mean to measure greatness by intellectual
power and intellectual achievement. Yes; Franklin's
great discovery, and the inventions which followed on it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
were made twenty-five years and more before Bunker
Hill."</p>

<p>"What is the association between Franklin and Robinson
Crusoe?" asked Alice. "I never read of one but
I think of the other."</p>

<p>Uncle Fritz's whole face beamed with approbation.</p>

<p>"You have started me upon one of my hobbies," said
he; "but I must not ride it too far. Franklin says himself
that De Foe's 'Essay on Projects' and Cotton Mather's
'Essay to do Good' were two books which perhaps gave
him a turn of thinking which had an influence on some
of the events in his after life. And you may notice how
an 'Essay on Projects' might start his passion for having
things done better than in the ways he saw. The books
that he was brought up on and with were books of
De Foe's own time,&mdash;none of them more popular among
reading people of Boston than De Foe's own books, for
De Foe was a great light among their friends in England.</p>

<p>"If Robinson Crusoe, on his second voyage, which
was in the year 1718, had run into Boston for supplies,
as he thought of doing; and if old Judge Sewall had
asked him to dinner,&mdash;as he would have been likely
to do, for Robinson was a godly old gentleman then,
of intelligence and fortune,&mdash;if there had been by accident
a vacant place at the table at the last moment,
Judge Sewall might have sent round to Franklin's father
to ask him to come in. For the elder Franklin, though
only a tallow-chandler,&mdash;and only Goodman Franklin,
not <i>Mr.</i> Franklin,&mdash;was a member of the church, well
esteemed. He led the singing at the Old South after
Judge Sewall's voice broke down.</p>

<p>"Nay, when one remembers how much Sewall had to
do with printing, one might imagine that the boy Ben<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Franklin should wait at the door with a proof-sheet, and
even take off his boy's hat as Robinson Crusoe came in."</p>

<p>Here Bedford Long put in a remark:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There are things in Robinson Crusoe's accounts of
his experiments in making his pipkins, which ought to
bring him into any book of American inventors."</p>

<p>"I never thought before," said Fergus, "that De Foe's
experiences in making tiles and tobacco-pipes and drain-pipes
fitted him for all that learned discussion of glazing,
when Robinson Crusoe makes his pots and pans."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Uncle Fritz; "that must be so.&mdash;Well,
as you say, Alice, there are whole sentences in that narrative
which you could suppose Franklin wrote, and
in his works whole sentences which would fit in closely
with De Foe's writing. The style of the younger man
very closely resembles that of the older."</p>

<p>"And Franklin would have been very much pleased
to hear you say so."</p>

<p>"He was forever inventing," said Uncle Fritz. "As I
said, he was worried unless things could be better done.
If he was in a storm, he wanted to still the waves. If the
chimney smoked, he wanted to make a better fireplace.
If he heard a girl play the musical-glasses, he must have
and make a better set."</p>

<p>"And if the house was struck by lightning, he went
out and put up a lightning-rod."</p>

<p>"He had a little book by which people should make
themselves better; for he rightly considered that unless
a man could do this, he could make no other improvement
of much account."</p>

<p>And when Uncle Fritz had said this, he found the
passage, which he bade John read to them.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<h3>FRANKLIN'S METHOD OF GROWING BETTER.</h3>

<p>"I made a little book in which I allotted a page for
each of the virtues. [He had classified the virtues and
made a list of thirteen, which will be named below.] I
ruled each page with red ink, so as to have seven columns,
one for each day of the week, marking each column with
a letter for the day. I crossed these columns with thirteen
red lines, marking the beginning of each line with
the first letter of one of the virtues, on which line and
in its proper column I might mark, by a little black spot,
every fault I found upon examination to have been committed
respecting that virtue upon that day. The thirteen
virtues were: 1. <span class="smcap">Temperance</span>; 2. <span class="smcap">Silence</span>; 3. <span class="smcap">Order</span>;
4. <span class="smcap">Resolution</span>; 5. <span class="smcap">Frugality</span>; 6. <span class="smcap">Industry</span>; 7. <span class="smcap">Sincerity</span>;
8. <span class="smcap">Justice</span>; 9. <span class="smcap">Moderation</span>; 10. <span class="smcap">Cleanliness</span>;
11. <span class="smcap">Tranquillity</span>; 12. <span class="smcap">Chastity</span>; 13. <span class="smcap">Humility</span>. Each
of these appears, by its full name or its initial, on every
page of the book. But the full name of one only appears
on each page.</p>

<p>"My intention being to acquire the habitude of these
virtues, I judged it would be well not to distract my attention
by attempting the whole at once, but to fix it on one
of them at a time, and when I should be master of that,
then to proceed to another,&mdash;and so on, till I should have
gone through the thirteen; and as the previous acquisition
might facilitate the acquisition of certain others, I
arranged them with that view. Temperance first, as it
tends to procure that coolness and clearness of head
which is so necessary where constant vigilance has to be
kept up, and a guard maintained against the unremitting
attraction of ancient habits, and the force of perpetual
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>temptations."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> And so he goes on to show how Temperance
would prepare for Silence, Silence for Order,
Order for Resolution, and thus to the end.</p>

<p>Here is the first page of the book, with the marks for
the first six of the virtues.</p>


<div class='center'>

<p>"I determined to give a week's strict attention to each
of the virtues successively. Thus, in the first week my
great guard was to avoid every the least offence against
<i>Temperance</i>, leaving the other virtues to their ordinary
chance, only marking every evening the faults of the day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Thus, if in the first week I could keep my first line,
marked T, clear of spots, I supposed the habit of that
virtue so much strengthened, and its opposite weakened,
that I might venture extending my attention to include
the next, and for the following week keep both lines clear
of spots. Proceeding thus to the last, I could go through
a course complete in thirteen weeks, and four courses in
a year. And like him who having a garden to weed
does not attempt to eradicate all the bad herbs at once,
which would exceed his reach and his strength, but works
on one of the beds at a time, and, having accomplished
the first, proceeds to the second, so I should have, I
hoped, the encouraging pleasure of seeing on my pages
the progress I made in virtue, by clearing successively my
lines of their spots, till in the end, by a number of courses,
I should be happy in viewing a clean book, after a thirteen
weeks' daily examination."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Uncle Fritz said that this plan of Franklin's had been
quite a favorite plan of different people at the end of the
last century. Richard Lovell Edgeworth, and Mr. Day,
and a good many of the other reformers in England, and
many in France, really thought that if people only knew
what was right they would all begin and do it. They had
to learn, by their own experience or somebody's, that the
difficulty was generally deeper down.</p>

<p>There was a man, named Droz, who published a little
book called "The Art of being Happy," with tables on
which every night you were to mark yourself, as a school-mistress
marks scholars at school, 10 for truth, 3 for temper,
5 for industry, 9 for frugality, and so on.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>
<p>"But in the long run," said Uncle Fritz, "there may
be too much self-examination. If you really look up and
not down, and look forward and not back, and loyally
lend a hand, why, you can afford to look out and not in,
in general."</p>

<p>Fergus brought the talk back to the lightning-rod, and
asked where was the earliest hint of it.</p>

<p>The history seems to be this. In the year 1747 a gentleman
named Collinson sent to Franklin, from England
or Scotland, one of the glass tubes with which people
were then trying electrical experiments. Franklin was
very much interested. He went on repeating the experiments
which had been made in England and on the Continent
of Europe. With his general love of society in such
things, he had other glass tubes made, and gave them to
his friends.</p>

<p>He had one immense advantage over the wise men of
England and France, in the superior dryness of our air,
which greatly favors such experiments. Almost any one
of the young Americans who will read this book has tried
the experiment of exciting electricity by shuffling across a
Brussels carpet on a dry floor, and then lighting the gas
from a gas-jet by the spark. But when you tell an Englishman
in London that you have done this, he thinks at
first that you are making fun of him. For it is very seldom
that the air and the carpet and the floor are all dry
enough for the experiment to succeed in England. This
difference of climate accounts for the difficulty which the
philosophers in England sometimes found in repeating
Dr. Franklin's experiments.</p>

<p>When it came to lightning and experiments about that,
he had another very great advantage; for we have many
more thunder-storms than they have. In the year 1752,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
when Mr. Watson was very eager to try the lightning experiments
in England, he seems to have had, in all the
summer, but two storms of thunder and lightning.</p>

<p>Franklin made his apparatus on a scale which now
seems almost gigantic. The "conductor" of an electrical
machine such as you will generally see in a college
laboratory is seldom more than two feet long. Franklin's
conductor, which was hung by silk from the top of his
room, was a cylinder ten feet long and one foot in diameter,
covered with gilt paper. In his "Leyden battery"
he used five glass jars, as big as large water-pails,&mdash;they
held nine gallons each. One night he had arranged to
kill a turkey by a shock from two of these. He received
the shock himself, by accident, and it almost killed him.
He had a theory that if turkeys were killed by electricity,
the meat would perhaps be more tender.</p>

<p>He acknowledges Mr. Collinson's present of the glass
tube as early as March 28, 1747. On the 11th of July
he writes to Collinson that they ("we") had discovered
the power of points to withdraw electricity silently and
continuously. On this discovery the lightning-rod is
based. He describes this quality, first observed by Mr.
Hopkinson, in the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The first is the wonderful effect of pointed bodies,
both in <i>drawing off</i> and <i>throwing off</i> the electrical fire.</p>

<p>"For example, place an iron shot, of three or four
inches diameter, on the mouth of a clean, dry glass bottle.
By a fine silken thread from the ceiling, right over the
mouth of the bottle, suspend a small cork ball about the
bigness of a marble; the thread of such a length, as that
the cork ball may rest against the side of the shot. Electrify
the shot, and the ball will be repelled to the distance
of four or five inches, more or less, according to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
quantity of electricity. When in this state, if you present
to the shot the point of a long, slender, sharp bodkin, at
six or eight inches distance, the repellency is instantly
destroyed, and the cork flies to the shot. A blunt body
must be brought within an inch and draw a spark, to produce
the same effect. To prove that the electrical fire is
<i>drawn off</i> by the point, if you take the blade of the bodkin
out of the wooden handle, and fix it in a stick of sealing-wax,
and then present it at the distance aforesaid, or if you
bring it very near, no such effect follows; but sliding one
finger along the wax till you touch the blade, the ball flies
to the shot immediately. If you present the point in the
dark, you will see, sometimes at a foot distance and more,
a light gather upon it, like that of a firefly or glow-worm;
the less sharp the point, the nearer you must bring it to
observe the light; and at whatever distance you see the
light, you may draw off the electrical fire, and destroy the
repellency. If a cork ball so suspended be repelled by
the tube, and a point be presented quick to it, though at a
considerable distance, it is surprising to see how suddenly
it flies back to the tube. Points of wood will do near as
well as those of iron, provided the wood is not dry; for
perfectly dry wood will no more conduct electricity than
sealing-wax.</p>

<p>"To show that points will <i>throw off</i> as well as <i>draw off</i>
the electrical fire, lay a long, sharp needle upon the shot,
and you cannot electrize the shot so as to make it repel
the cork ball. Or fix a needle to the end of a suspended
gun-barrel or iron rod, so as to point beyond it like a little
bayonet; and while it remains there, the gun-barrel or
rod cannot, by applying the tube to the other end, be
electrized so as to give a spark, the fire continually running
out silently at the point. In the dark you may see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
it make the same appearance as it does in the case before
mentioned."</p>

<p>The next summer, that of 1748, the experiments went
so far, that in a letter of Franklin's to Collinson he proposed
the electrical dinner-party, which was such a delight
to Harry and Lucy:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Chagrined a little that we have been hitherto able to
produce nothing in this way of use to mankind, and the
hot weather coming on when electrical experiments are
not so agreeable, it is proposed to put an end to them for
this season, somewhat humorously, in a party of pleasure
on the banks of the <i>Skuylkill</i>. Spirits, at the same time,
are to be fired by a spark sent from side to side through
the river, without any other conductor than the water; an
experiment which we some time since performed, to the
amazement of many. A turkey is to be killed for our
dinner by the <i>electrical shock</i>, and roasted by the <i>electrical
jack</i>, before a fire kindled by the <i>electrified bottle</i>; when
the healths of all the famous electricians in England, Holland,
France, and Germany are to be drank in <i>electrified
bumpers</i>, under the discharge of guns from the <i>electrical
battery</i>."</p>

<p>It was in a letter to Collinson of the next year, 1749,&mdash;as
I suppose, though it is not dated,&mdash;that the project of
the lightning-rod first appears. It is too long to copy.
The paragraphs most important in this view are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"42. An electrical spark, drawn from an irregular body
at some distance, is scarcely ever straight, but shows
crooked and waving in the air. So do the flashes of lightning,
the clouds being very irregular bodies.</p>

<p>"43. As electrified clouds pass over a country, high hills
and high trees, lofty towers, spires, masts of ships, chim<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>neys,
&amp;c., as so many prominences and points, draw the
electrical fire, and the whole cloud discharges there.</p>

<p>"44. Dangerous, therefore, is it to take shelter under a
tree during a thunder-gust. It has been fatal to many,
both men and beasts.</p>

<p>"45. It is safer to be in the open field for another reason.
When the clothes are wet, if a flash in its way to the ground
should strike your head, it may run in the water over the
surface of your body; whereas, if your clothes were dry,
it would go through the body, because the blood and
other humors, containing so much water, are more ready
conductors.</p>

<p>"Hence a wet rat cannot be killed by the exploding
electrical bottle, when a dry rat may."</p>

<p>In a letter of 1750, based upon observations made in
1749, Franklin said distinctly, after describing some artificial
lightning which he had made:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If these things are so, may not the knowledge of this
power of points be of use to mankind, in preserving houses,
churches, ships, &amp;c., from the stroke of lightning, by directing
us to fix, on the highest parts of these edifices,
upright rods of iron made sharp as a needle, and gilded to
prevent rusting, and from the foot of those rods a wire
down the outside of the building into the ground, or down
round one of the shrouds of a ship, and down her side till
it reaches the water? Would not these pointed rods probably
draw the electrical fire silently out of a cloud before it
came nigh enough to strike, and thereby secure us from
that most sudden and terrible mischief?</p>

<p>"To determine the question whether the clouds that
contain lightning are electrified or not, I would propose an
experiment to be tried where it may be done conveniently.
On the top of some high tower or steeple, place a kind of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
sentry-box, big enough to contain a man and an electrical
stand. From the middle of the stand let an iron rod rise
and pass bending out of the door and then upright twenty
or thirty feet, pointed very sharp at the end. If the electrical
stand be kept clean and dry, a man standing on it,
when such clouds are passing low, might be electrified and
afford sparks, the rod drawing fire to him from a cloud.
If any danger to the man should be apprehended (though
I think there would be none), let him stand on the floor of
his box, and now and then bring near to the rod the loop
of a wire that has one end fastened to the leads, he holding
it by a wax handle; so the sparks, if the rod is electrified,
will strike from the rod to the wire, and not affect him."</p>

<p>The Royal Society "did not think these papers worth
printing"!</p>

<p>But, happily, Collinson printed them, and they went all
over Europe. The demonstration of the lightning theory,
which he had wrought out by his own experiments, was
made in France, May 10, 1752; and in Philadelphia by
Franklin with the kite in the next month, before he had
heard of the success in France. Franklin's friend Dalibard
tried the French experiment. Here is his account of
it, as he sent it to the French Academy, as Roxana translated
it for the young people:&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have had perfect success in following out the course
indicated by Mr. Franklin.</p>

<p>I had set up at Marly-la-ville, situated six leagues from
Paris, in a fine plain at a very elevated level, a round rod
of iron, about an inch in diameter, forty feet long, and
sharply pointed at its upper extremity. To secure greater
fineness at the point, I had it armed with tempered steel,
and then burnished, for want of gilding, so as to keep it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
from rusting; beside that, this iron rod is bent near its
lower end into two acute but rounded angles; the first angle
is two feet from the lower end, and the second takes a
contrary direction at three feet from the first.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Wednesday, the 10th of May, 1752, between two and
three in the afternoon, a man named Coiffier, an old dragoon,
whom I had intrusted with making the observations
in my absence, having heard rather a loud clap of thunder,
hastened at once to the machine, took the phial with the
wire, presented the loop of the wire to the rod, saw a
small bright spark come from it, and heard it crackle.
He then drew a second spark, brighter than the first and
with a louder sound! He called his neighbors, and sent
for the Prior. This gentleman hastened to the spot as
fast as he could: the parishioners, seeing the haste of their
priest, imagined that poor Coiffier had been killed by the
thunder; the alarm was spread in the village; the hail-storm
which began did not prevent the flock from following
its shepherd. This honest priest approached the
machine, and, seeing that there was no danger, went to
work himself and drew strong sparks. The cloud from
which the storm and hail came was no more than a quarter
of an hour in passing directly over our machine, and
only this one thunder-clap was heard. As soon as the
cloud had passed, and no more sparks were drawn from
the iron rod, the Prior of Marly sent off Monsieur Coiffier
himself, to bring me the following letter, which he wrote
in haste:&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can now inform you, Sir, of what you are looking
for. The experiment is completely successful. To-day,
at twenty minutes past two, <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>, the thunder rolled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
directly over Marly; the clap was rather loud. The desire
to oblige you, and my own curiosity, made me leave my
arm-chair, where I was occupied in reading. I went to
Coiffier's, who had already sent a child to me, whom I met
on the way, to beg me to come. I redoubled my speed
through a torrent of hail. When I arrived at the place
where the bent rod was set up, I presented the wire, approaching
it several times toward the rod. At the distance
of an inch and a half, or about that, there came out of the
rod a little column of bluish fire smelling of sulphur, which
struck the loop of the wire with an extreme and rapid energy,
and occasioned a sound like that which might be
made by striking on the rod with a key. I repeated the
experiment at least six times, in the space of about four
minutes, in the presence of several persons; and each experiment
which I made lasted the space of a <i>Pater</i> and an
<i>Ave</i>. I tried to go on; the action of the fire slackened
little by little. I went nearer, and drew nothing more but
a few sparks, and at last nothing appeared.</p>

<p>The thunder-clap which caused this event was followed
by no other; it all ended in a great quantity of hail.
I was so occupied with what I saw at the moment of the
experiment, that, having been struck on the arm a little
above my elbow, I cannot say whether it was in touching
the wire or the rod, I was not even aware of the injury
which the blow had given me at the moment when I received
it; but as the pain continued, on my return home
I uncovered my arm before Coiffier, and we perceived a
bruised mark winding round the arm, like what a wire
would have made if my bare flesh had been struck by it.
As I was going back from Coiffier's house, I met Monsieur
le Vicaire, Monsieur de Milly, and the schoolmaster, to
whom I related what had just happened. They all three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
declared that they smelt an odor of sulphur, which struck
them more as they approached me. I carried the same
odor home with me, and my servants noticed it without
my having said anything to them about it.</p>

<p>This, Monsieur, is an account given in haste, but simple
and true, which I attest, and you may depend on my
being ready to give evidence of this event on every opportunity.
Coiffier was the first who made the experiment,
and repeated it several times; it was only on account of
what he had seen that he sent to ask me to come. If
other witnesses than he and I are necessary, you will find
them. Coiffier is in haste to set out.</p>

<p>I am, with respectful consideration, Monsieur,</p>

<p class="center">Yours, &amp;c.,</p>
<p class="ralign">[Signed] &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="smcap">Raulet</span>, <i>Prior of Marly</i>.</p>

<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">May</span> 10, 1752.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I do not understand," said Uncle Fritz, "how it happened
that no one attempted the experiment before.
Franklin had proposed it, very distinctly, in 1750. His
friend Dr. Stuber says that he was waiting for the erection
of a steeple in Philadelphia. You see, the Quakers, who
had founded this city, would have none; they derided
what they called 'steeple-houses,' little foreseeing what
advantage could be drawn from a steeple.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, in 1750, in October, he did take a view
of New York from the 'Dutch Church steeple,' which
had been struck by lightning in the spring of that year.
And here he was able to confirm his theory, by seeing
that 'wire is a good conductor of lightning, as it is of
electricity.'"</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<h3>MUSICAL GLASSES.</h3>

<p>While some of the children were reading these electrical
passages, others were turning over the next volume; and
to their great delight, they found a picture of the "Musical
Glasses."</p>

<p>"I never had the slightest idea what musical glasses
were," said Jack; and he spouted from Goldsmith the
passage from "The Vicar of Wakefield," where the fashionable
ladies from London talked about "Shakspeare
and the musical glasses."</p>

<p>"Were they Dr. Franklin's musical glasses?"</p>

<p>"I never thought of that," said Uncle Fritz, well
pleased; "but I think it is so. John, look and see what
year 'The Vicar of Wakefield' was written in."</p>

<p>John turned to the Cyclop&aelig;dia, and it proved that
Goldsmith wrote that book in 1766.</p>

<p>"And you see," said Uncle Fritz, "that it was in 1762
that Franklin made his improvement, and that Mr. Puckeridge,
the Irish gentleman, had arranged his glasses before.
I think you would find that the instrument gradually
worked its way into fashion,&mdash;slowly, as such things then
did in England,&mdash;and that Goldsmith knew about Dr.
Franklin's modification.</p>

<p>"I do not now remember any other place where Goldsmith's
life and his touched. But they must have known
a great many of the same people. Franklin was all mixed
up with the Grub Street people."</p>

<p>Meanwhile John was following up the matter in the
Cyclop&aelig;dia. But he did not find "Armonica." Uncle
Fritz bade him try in the "H" volume; and there, sure
enough, was "Harmonica," with quite a little history of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the invention. Mr. Puckeridge's fascinating name is
there tamed down to Pochrich, probably by some German
translator. Dr. Franklin's instrument is described,
and the Cyclop&aelig;dia man adds:&mdash;</p>

<p>"From the effect which it was supposed to have upon
the nervous system, it has been suggested that the fingers
should not be allowed to come in immediate contact with
the glasses, but that the tones should be produced by
means of keys, as with a harpsichord. Such an instrument
has been made, and called the '<i>harpsichord harmonica</i>.'
But these experiments have not produced
anything of much value. It is impossible that the delicacy,
the swell, and the continuation of the tone should
be carried to such perfection as in the simpler method.
The harmonica, however much it excels all other instruments
in the delicacy and duration of its tones, yet is
confined to those of a soft and melancholy character and
to slow, solemn movements, and can hardly be combined
to advantage with other instruments. In accompanying
the human voice it throws it into the shade; and in concerts
the other instruments lose in effect, because so far
inferior to it in tone. It is therefore best enjoyed by
itself, and may produce a charming effect in certain
romantic situations."</p>

<p>"'Romantic situations'! I should think so," said Mabel,
laughing. "Is not that like the dear German man
that wrote this? I see myself lugging my harmonica to
the edge of the Kauterskill Falls."</p>

<p>"How do you know he was a German?" said Alice.</p>

<p>"Because, where John read 'the simpler method,' it
says 'the before-mentioned method.' No Englishman or
American in his senses ever said 'before-mentioned' if
he could help himself."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do let us see how dear Dr. Franklin made his
machine."</p>

<p>And the girls unfolded the old-fashioned picture, which
is in the sixth volume of Sparks's Franklin, and read his
description of it as he wrote it to Beccaria.</p>

<p>"Is it the Beccaria who did about capital punishment?"
asked Fergus.</p>

<p>"No," Uncle Fritz said, "though they lived at the
same time. They were not brothers. The capital-punishment
man was the Marquis <i>of</i> Beccaria, and that <i>of</i>
makes a great difference in Europe. This man 'did'
electricity, as you would say; and his name is plain
Beccaria without any <i>of</i>."</p>

<p>Then Mabel, commanding silence, at last read the letter
to Beccaria. And when she had done, Uncle Fritz said
that he should think there might be many a boy or girl
who could not buy a piano or what he profanely called
a Yang-Yang,&mdash;by which he meant a reed organ,&mdash;who
would like to make a harmonica. The letter, in a part
not copied here, tells how to tune the glasses. And
any one who lived near a glass-factory, and was on the
good-natured side of a good workman, could have the
glasses made without much expense.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Letter of Franklin to J. B. Beccaria.</i></p>

<p class="ralign">
<span class="smcap">London</span>, July 13, 1762. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reverend Sir</span>,&mdash;... Perhaps, however, it may be
agreeable to you, as you live in a musical country, to have
an account of the new instrument lately added here to the
great number that charming science was already possessed
of. As it is an instrument that seems peculiarly adapted
to Italian music, especially that of the soft and plaintive
kind, I will endeavor to give you such a description of it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
and of the manner of constructing it, that you or any of
your friends may be enabled to imitate it, if you incline
so to do, without being at the expense and trouble I have
been to bring it to its present perfection.</p>

<p>You have doubtless heard of the sweet tone that is drawn
from a drinking-glass by passing a wet finger round its brim.
One Mr. Puckeridge, a gentleman from Ireland, was the
first who thought of playing tunes formed of these tones.
He collected a number of glasses of different sizes, fixed
them near each other on a table, tuned them by putting
into them water more or less, as each note required. The
tones were brought out by passing his finger round their
brims. He was unfortunately burned here, with his instrument,
in a fire which consumed the house he lived in.
Mr. E. Delaval, a most ingenious member of our Royal
Society, made one in imitation of it, with a better form
and choice of glasses, which was the first I saw or heard.
Being charmed by the sweetness of its tones, and the
music he produced from it, I wished only to see the
glasses disposed in a more convenient form, and brought
together in a narrower compass, so as to admit of a
greater number of tones, and all within reach of hand
to a person sitting before the instrument, which I accomplished,
after various intermediate trials, and less commodious
forms, both of glasses and construction, in the
following manner.</p>

<p>The glasses are blown as nearly as possible in the form
of hemispheres, having each an open neck or socket in the
middle. The thickness of the glass near the brim about
a tenth of an inch, or hardly quite so much, but thicker
as it comes nearer the neck, which in the largest glasses
is about an inch deep, and an inch and a half wide within,
these dimensions lessening as the glasses themselves dimin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>ish
in size, except that the neck of the smallest ought not
to be shorter than half an inch. The largest glass is nine
inches diameter, and the smallest three inches. Between
these two are twenty-three different sizes, differing from
each other a quarter of an inch in diameter. To make a
single instrument there should be at least six glasses blown
of each size; and out of this number one may probably
pick thirty-seven glasses (which are sufficient for three
octaves with all the semitones) that will be each either the
note one wants or a little sharper than that note, and all
fitting so well into each other as to taper pretty regularly
from the largest to the smallest. It is true there are not
thirty-seven sizes, but it often happens that two of the
same size differ a note or half-note in tone, by reason of a
difference in thickness, and these may be placed one in
the other without sensibly hurting the regularity of the
taper form.</p>

<p>The glasses being thus turned, you are to be provided
with a case for them, and a spindle on which they are to
be fixed. My case is about three feet long, eleven inches
every way wide at the biggest end; for it tapers all the
way, to adapt it better to the conical figure of the set of
glasses. This case opens in the middle of its height, and
the upper part turns up by hinges fixed behind. The
spindle, which is of hard iron, lies horizontally from end
to end of the box within, exactly in the middle, and is
made to turn on brass gudgeons at each end. It is round,
an inch in diameter at the thickest end, and tapering to a
quarter of an inch at the smallest. A square shank comes
from its thickest end through the box, on which shank a
wheel is fixed by a screw. This wheel serves as a fly to
make the motion equable, when the spindle with the
glasses is turned by the foot like a spinning-wheel. My<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
wheel is of mahogany, eighteen inches diameter, and
pretty thick, so as to conceal near its circumference about
twenty-five pounds of lead. An ivory pin is fixed in the
face of this wheel, and about four inches from the axis.
Over the neck of this pin is put the loop of the string that
comes up from the movable step to give it motion. The
case stands on a neat frame with four legs.</p>

<p>To fix the glasses on the spindle, a cork is first to be
fitted in each neck pretty tight, and projecting a little
without the neck, that the neck of one may not touch the
inside of another when put together, for that would make
a jarring. These corks are to be perforated with holes of
different diameters, so as to suit that part of the spindle
on which they are to be fixed. When a glass is put on, by
holding it stiffly between both hands, while another turns
the spindle, it may be gradually brought to its place. But
care must be taken that the hole be not too small, lest, in
forcing it up, the neck should split; nor too large, lest the
glass, not being firmly fixed, should turn or move on the
spindle, so as to touch or jar against its neighboring glass.
The glasses are thus placed one in another, the largest on
the biggest end of the spindle, which is to the left hand;
the neck of this glass is towards the wheel, and the next
goes into it in the same position, only about an inch of its
brim appearing beyond the brim of the first; thus proceeding,
every glass when fixed shows about an inch of its
brim (or three quarters of an inch, or half an inch, as they
grow smaller) beyond the brim of the glass that contains
it; and it is from these exposed parts of each glass that
the tone is drawn, by laying a finger upon one of them as
the spindle and glasses turn round.</p>

<p>My largest glass is G, a little below the reach of a common
voice, and my highest G, including three complete<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
octaves. To distinguish the glasses the more readily to
the eye, I have painted the apparent parts of the glasses
withinside, every semitone white, and the other notes of the
octave with the seven prismatic colors,&mdash;viz., C, red; D,
orange; E, yellow; F, green; G, blue; A, indigo; B,
purple; and C, red again,&mdash;so that glasses of the same
color (the white excepted) are always octaves to each
other.</p>

<p>This instrument is played upon by sitting before the
middle of the set of glasses, as before the keys of a harpsichord,
turning them with the foot, and wetting them now
and then with a sponge and clean water. The fingers
should be first a little soaked in water, and quite free from
all greasiness; a little fine chalk upon them is sometimes
useful, to make them catch the glass and bring out the
tone more readily. Both hands are used, by which
means different parts are played together. Observe that
the tones are best brought out when the glasses turn <i>from</i>
the ends of the fingers, not when they turn <i>to</i> them.</p>

<p>The advantages of this instrument are, that its tones are
incomparably sweet, beyond those of any other; that they
may be swelled and softened at pleasure by stronger or
weaker pressure of the finger, and continued to any length;
and that the instrument, being once well tuned, never
again wants tuning.</p>

<p>In honor of your musical language, I have borrowed
from it the name of this instrument, calling it the Armonica.</p>

<p class="center">With great respect and esteem, I am, &amp;c.,</p>

<small>THEORISTS OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.</small></h2>

<h3>RICHARD LOVELL EDGEWORTH.</h3>


<p>At the next meeting there was a slight deviation from
the absolutely expected. Bedford and Mabel desired
to dispense with the regular order of the day, and
moved for permission to bring in a new inventor, "invented
by myself," said Mabel,&mdash;"entirely by myself,
assisted by Bedford. Nobody that I know of ever heard
of him before. He is a new discovery."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked Horace, somewhat piqued that
there should be any one interesting of whom he had not
heard even the name.</p>

<p>"What did he invent?" asked Emma.</p>

<p>"Did he write memoirs?" asked Fergus.</p>

<p>"Did you ever read 'Frank'?" asked Mabel, in what
is known as the Socratic method.</p>

<p>There was a slight stir at the mention of this little
classic. Few seemed to be able to answer in the
affirmative.</p>

<p>"I have read 'Rollo,'" said Horace.</p>

<p>"I have read 'Frank,'" said Will Withers, "and 'Harry
and Lucy,' and the 'Parents' Assistant,' and 'Sandford and
Merton,' and 'Henry Milner.' In fact, there are few of
those books, all kindred volumes, which I have not read.
They have had an important effect upon my later life."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hinc illae lachrymae," in a low tone from Clem
Waters.</p>

<p>For Colonel Ingham, the turn taken by the conversation
had a peculiar charm. He was of the generation
before the rest, and what were to them but ghostly ideals
were to him glad memories of a happy past.</p>

<p>"Good!" said he. "'Frank' was, in a sense, the
greatest book ever written. Do you remember that part
where Frank lifted up the skirts of his coat when passing
through the greenhouse?" he asked of Mabel.</p>

<p>"I should think I did," said Mabel and Will. As for
Bedford, he had only a vague recollection of it. The
others considered the conversation to be trembling upon
the verge of insanity.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Florence, gently, "I might be allowed
to suggest that although you have heard of 'Frank' and
those other persons mentioned, we have not. I do not
think that I ever heard of an inventor named Frank,&mdash;did
he have any other name?&mdash;and I am usually considered,"
she went on modestly, "tolerably well informed.
Therefore the present conversation, though probably edifying
in a high degree to those who have read 'Frank,' or
who have some interest in horticulture and greenhouses,
can hardly fail to be very stupid to those of us who have
not."</p>

<p>"My dear child," said the Colonel, "you are right.
Mabel and I, and Will and Bedford here, are of the
generation that is passing off the stage. We look back to
the things of our youth, hardly considering that there are
those to whom that period suggests Noah and his ark."</p>

<p>"But who is the inventor?" asked some one who
thought that the conversation was gradually leaving the
trodden path.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, we had almost forgotten him," said Bedford.</p>

<p>"The inventor," said Mabel, producing two volumes
from under her arm, "is Mr. Richard Lovell Edgeworth,
the father of Maria Edgeworth."</p>

<p>"What did he invent?" asked many of the company.</p>

<p>"He invented the telegraph."</p>

<p>"Well, I never knew that before."</p>

<p>"I thought Morse invented the telegraph."</p>

<p>"Didn't Dr. Franklin invent the telegraph?"</p>

<p>"I thought Edison&mdash;"</p>

<p>Other remarks were also made, showing a certain
amount of incredulity.</p>

<p>"You mistake," said Bedford, placidly; "you are all of
you under a misapprehension. I think that you all of you
allude to the electric telegraph,&mdash;an invention of a later date
than that of Mr. Edgeworth, and one of more value, as far
as practical affairs are concerned. No; Mr. Edgeworth invented,
or thinks he invented, the telegraph as it was used
in the eighteenth century and the early part of the nineteenth,
sometimes named the Semaphore. It wasn't a
difficult invention, and I don't believe it ever came to any
very practical use as constructed by Edgeworth, though
French telegraphs were very useful."</p>

<p>"What kind of a telegraph was it?"</p>

<p>"Well, it was just the kind of a telegraph that the conductor
of a railroad train is when he waves his arms to the
engineer to go ahead. There's an account of it by
Edgeworth in one of these books, with pictures to it."</p>

<p>"But my chief interest about Edgeworth," said Mabel,
"is in his memoirs, which are written partly by himself and
partly by his daughter. They are really very amusing.
He was married five times,&mdash;once with a door-key when
he was only fourteen."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>This startling intelligence roused even Colonel Ingham
to demand particulars. Was he married to all five at
once? to all of them when he was only fourteen?</p>

<p>"No," admitted Mabel, with some regret; "he was
married to them, all at different times, and he was divorced
from the one he married at fourteen with the
door-key."</p>

<p>"They were only married for fun," said Bedford. "It
was all a joke. They were at a wedding, and they thought
it would be funny after the real marriage to have a mock
one. So they did, and married Edgeworth to a girl who
was there. It was a real marriage, for they were afterwards
divorced."</p>

<p>"Well," said Sam Edmeston, "I shall be glad to hear
about this gentleman, I'm sure, though I never did hear
of him before. But may I ask why it was necessary to
introduce him by means of an allusion to 'Frank' and
other works which we have few of us ever read, though
it is very possible that we may some of us have heard of
them?"</p>

<p>"I see why Mabel spoke first of 'Frank,'" said Colonel
Ingham. "And I think that she did very well to bring
Edgeworth in as she has done. And Edgeworth, though
I had not thought of him before, is very fit to be one
of our inventors, not so much for his individual accomplishments,
which were little more than curious,&mdash;telegraph
and all,&mdash;as for being a good representative of his
age. Those of you who know a little of the century between
1750 and 1850 know that it was an age to which
many of the secrets of physical science were being opened
for the first time. Everybody was going back to Nature
to see what he could learn from her. This movement
swept all over France and England. Every gentleman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
dabbled in the sciences, and made his experiments and
inventions. Voltaire in France had a great laboratory
made for him in which he passed some years in chemical
experiments. It was the age, too, of great inventions,&mdash;of
the application of physical forces to the life of man.
The invention of the steam-engine by Watt, and the applications
of it to the locomotive and the steamboat, came
along toward the end of this period, and marked the work
of the greatest men. But every one could not invent a
steam-engine. So, by the hundreds of country gentlemen
who studied science, chemistry, and astronomy, and the
rest, there were constructed hundreds of orreries, globes,
carriages, model-telegraphs, and such things; and it is of
these men that Edgeworth is the best, or at least the
most available, representative, on account of his very
interesting memoirs.</p>

<p>"Such books as 'Harry and Lucy' and 'Frank' are
the mirror of this movement. But to this is joined something
more, which John Morley speaks of in saying, 'An
age touched by the spirit of hope turns naturally to the
education of the young.' Then people knew that their
own times were about as worthless as times could well be;
but as they learned more, they began to hope that things
were improving, and that the children might see better
times than those in which the fathers lived. And as
physical science was to them an all-important factor in
this approaching millennium, they took pains to teach
these things to the young. Any of you who have read
'Frank' or 'Sandford and Merton' will see what I mean.
It was the hope that the children might be able to take
the work where the fathers left it, and carry it on. And
the children did. But I do not believe that any one of
these eighteenth-century theorists had the first or vaguest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
idea of the point to which his children and grandchildren
would carry his work.</p>

<p>"So much for Mr. Edgeworth from my point of view,"
concluded the Colonel. "You will hear what he thought
of himself from Bedford."</p>


<h3>EDGEWORTH'S TELEGRAPH.</h3>

<h4>[DESCRIBED BY HIMSELF.]</h4>

<p>Bets of a rash or ingenious sort were in fashion in those
days, and one proposal of what was difficult and uncommon
led to another. A famous match was at that time
pending at Newmarket between two horses that were in
every respect as nearly equal as possible. Lord March,
one evening at Ranelagh, expressed his regret to Sir
Francis Delaval that he was not able to attend Newmarket
at the next meeting. "I am obliged," said he,
"to stay in London. I shall, however, be at the Turf
Coffee House. I shall station fleet horses on the road to
bring me the earliest intelligence of the event of the race,
and shall manage my bets accordingly."</p>

<p>I asked at what time in the evening he expected to
know who was winner. He said about nine in the evening.
I asserted that I should be able to name the winning
horse at four o'clock in the afternoon. Lord March
heard my assertion with so much incredulity as to urge
me to defend myself; and at length I offered to lay five
hundred pounds, that I would in London name the winning
horse at Newmarket at five o'clock in the evening
of the day when the great match in question was to be
run. Sir Francis, having looked at me for encouragement,
offered to lay five hundred pounds on my side; Lord<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Eglintoun did the same; Shaftoe and somebody else took
up their bets; and the next day we were to meet at the
Turf Coffee House, to put our bets in writing. After we
went home, I explained to Sir Francis Delaval the means
that I proposed to use. I had early been acquainted
with Wilkins's "Secret and Swift Messenger;" I had also
read in Hooke's Works of a scheme of this sort, and I
had determined to employ a telegraph nearly resembling
that which I have since published. The machinery I
knew could be prepared in a few days.</p>

<p>Sir Francis immediately perceived the feasibility of my
scheme, and indeed its certainty of success. It was summer-time;
and by employing a sufficient number of persons,
we could place our machines so near as to be almost
out of the power of the weather. When we all met at the
Turf Coffee House, I offered to double my bet; so did
Sir Francis. The gentlemen on the opposite side were
willing to accept my offer; but before I would conclude
my wager, I thought it fair to state to Lord March that I
did not depend upon the fleetness or strength of horses
to carry the desired intelligence, but upon other means,
which I had, of being informed in London which horse
had actually won at Newmarket, between the time when
the race should be concluded and five o 'clock in the
evening. My opponents thanked me for my candor and
declined the bet. My friends blamed me extremely for
giving up such an advantageous speculation. None of
them, except Sir Francis, knew the means which I had
intended to employ; and he kept them a profound secret,
with a view to use them afterwards for his own purposes.
With that energy which characterized everything in which
he engaged, he immediately erected, under my directions,
an apparatus between his house and part of Piccadilly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>&mdash;an
apparatus which was never suspected to be telegraphic.
I also set up a night telegraph between a house which Sir
F. Delaval occupied at Hampstead, and one to which I
had access in Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury. This
nocturnal telegraph answered well, but was too expensive
for common use.</p>

<p>Upon my return home to Hare Hatch, I tried many
experiments on different modes of telegraphic communication.
My object was to combine secrecy with expedition.
For this purpose I intended to employ windmills, which
might be erected for common economical uses, and which
might at the same time afford easy means of communication
from place to place upon extraordinary occasions.
There is a windmill at Nettlebed, which can be distinctly
seen with a good glass from Assy Hill, between Maidenhead
and Henly, the highest ground in England south of
the Trent. With the assistance of Mr. Perrot, of Hare
Hatch, I ascertained the practicability of my scheme
between these places, which are nearly sixteen miles
asunder.</p>

<p>I have had occasion to show my claim to the revival of
this invention in modern times, and in particular to prove
that I had practised telegraphic communication in the
year 1767, long before it was ever attempted in France.
To establish these truths, I obtained from Mr. Perrot, a
Berkshire gentleman, who resided in the neighborhood of
Hare Hatch, and who was witness to my experiments, his
testimony to the facts which I have just related. I have
his letter; and before its contents were published in the
Memoirs of the Irish Academy for the year 1796, I
showed it to Lord Charlemont, President of the Royal
Irish Academy.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<h3>MR. EDGEWORTH'S TELEGRAPH IN IRELAND.</h3>

<h4>[DESCRIBED BY HIS DAUGHTER.]</h4>

<p>In August, 1794, my father made a trial of his telegraph
between Pakenham Hall and Edgeworth Town, a
distance of twelve miles. He found it to succeed beyond
his expectations; and in November following he made
another trial of it at Collon, at Mr. Foster's, in the county
of Louth. The telegraphs were on two hills, at fifteen
miles' distance from each other. A communication of
intelligence was made, and an answer received, in the
space of five minutes. Mr. Foster&mdash;my father's friend,
and the friend of everything useful to Ireland&mdash;was well
convinced of the advantage and security this country
would derive from a system of quick and certain communication;
and, being satisfied of the sufficiency of this
telegraph, advised that a memorial on the subject should
be drawn up for Government. Accordingly, under his
auspices, a memorial was presented, in 1795, to Lord
Camden, then Lord Lieutenant. His Excellency glanced
his eye over the paper, and said that he did not think
such an establishment necessary, but desired to reserve
the matter for further consideration. My father waited
in Dublin for some time. The suspense and doubt in
which courtiers are obliged to live is very different from
that state of philosophical doubt which the wise recommend,
and to which they are willing to submit. My
father's patience was soon exhausted. The county in
which he resided was then in a disturbed state; and he
was eager to return to his family, who required his protection.
Besides, to state things exactly as they were,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>his was not the sort of temper suited to attendance upon
the great.</p>

<p>The disturbances in the County of Longford were quieted
for a time by the military; but again, in the autumn of the
ensuing year (September, 1796), rumors of an invasion
prevailed, and spread with redoubled force through Ireland,
disturbing commerce, and alarming all ranks of well-disposed
subjects. My father wrote to Lord Carhampton,
then Commander-in-Chief, and to Mr. Pelham (now Lord
Chichester), who was then Secretary in Ireland, offering
his services. The Secretary requested Mr. Edgeworth
would furnish him with a memorial. Aware of the natural
antipathy that public men feel at the sight of long memorials,
this was made short enough to give it a chance of
being read.</p>


<h4>(Presented, Oct. 6, 1796.)</h4>

<p>Mr. Edgeworth will undertake to convey intelligence
from Dublin to Cork, and back to Dublin, by means of
fourteen or fifteen different stations, at the rate of one
hundred pounds per annum for each station, as long as
Government shall think proper; and from Dublin to any
other place, at the same rate, in proportion to the distance:
provided that when Government chooses to discontinue
the business, they shall pay one year's contract
over and above the current expense, as some compensation
for the prime cost of the apparatus, and the trouble of
the first establishment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a letter of a single page, accompanying this memorial,
it was stated, that to establish a telegraphic corps of
men sufficient to convey intelligence to every part of the
kingdom where it should be necessary, stations tenable
against a mob and against musketry might be effected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
for the sum of <i>six or seven thousand pounds</i>. It was
further observed, that of course there must be a considerable
difference between a partial and a general plan of
telegraphic communication; that Mr. Edgeworth was perfectly
willing to pursue either, or to adopt without reserve
any better plan that Government should approve. Thanks
were returned, and approbation expressed.</p>

<p>Nothing now appeared in suspense except the <i>mode</i> of
the establishment, whether it should be civil or military.
Meantime Mr. Pelham spoke of the Duke of York's wish
to have a reconnoitring telegraph, and observed that Mr.
Edgeworth's would be exactly what his Royal Highness
wanted. Mr. Edgeworth in a few days constructed a
portable telegraph, and offered it to Mr. Pelham. He
accepted it, and at his request my brother Lovell carried
it to England, and presented it to the Duke from Mr.
Pelham.</p>

<p>During the interval of my brother's absence in England,
my father had no doubt that arrangements were making
for a telegraphic establishment in Ireland. But the next
time he went to the castle, he saw signs of a change in
the Secretary's countenance, who seemed much hurried,&mdash;promised
he would write,&mdash;wrote, and conveyed, in
diplomatic form, a final refusal. Mr. Pelham indeed
endeavored to make it as civil as he could, concluding
his letter with these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The utility of a telegraph may hereafter be considered
greater; but I trust that at all events those talents which
have been directed to this pursuit will be turned to some
other object, and that the public will have the benefit of
that extraordinary activity and zeal which I have witnessed
on this occasion in some other institution which I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
sure that the ingenuity of the author will not require much
time to suggest.</p>

<p class="center">I have the honor to be, with great respect, &amp;c.,</p>

<p class="ralign"><span class="smcap">T. Pelham</span>.</p>

<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">Dublin Castle</span>, Nov. 17, 1796.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of his offer to establish a communication from the coast
of Cork to Dublin, at <i>his own expense</i>, no notice was
taken. "He had, as was known to Government, expended
&pound;500 of his own money; as much more would
have erected a temporary establishment for a year to
Cork. Thus the utility of this invention might have been
tried, and the most prudent government upon earth
could not have accused itself of extravagance in being
partner with a private gentleman in an experiment which
had, with inferior apparatus, and at four times the expense,
been tried in France and England, and approved."
The most favorable supposition by which we can account
for the conduct of the Irish Government in this business
is that a superior influence in England forbade them to
proceed. "It must," said my father, "be mortifying to
a viceroy who comes over to Ireland with enlarged views
and benevolent intentions, to discover, when he attempts
to act for himself, that he is peremptorily checked; that
a circle is chalked round him, beyond which he cannot
move."</p>

<p>No personal feelings of pique or disgust prevented my
father from renewing his efforts to be of service to his
country. Two months after the rejection of his telegraph,
on Friday the 30th of December, 1796, the French were
on the Irish coasts. Of this he received intelligence late
at night. Immediately he sent a servant express to the
Secretary, with a letter offering to erect telegraphs, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
he had in Dublin, on any line that Government should
direct, and proposing to bring his own men with him;
or to join the army with his portable telegraphs, to reconnoitre.
His servant was sent back with a note from
the Secretary, containing compliments and the promise
of a speedy answer; no further answer ever reached him.
Upon this emergency he could, with the assistance of his
friends, have established an immediate communication
between Dublin and the coast, which should not have cost
the country one shilling. My father showed no mortification
at the neglect with which he was treated, but
acknowledged that he felt much "concern in losing an
opportunity of saving an enormous expense to the public,
and of alleviating the anxiety and distress of thousands."
A telegraph was most earnestly wished for at this time by
the best-informed people in Ireland, as well as by those
whose perceptions had suddenly quickened at the view
of immediate danger. Great distress, bankruptcies, and
ruin to many families, were the consequences of this
attempted invasion. The troops were harassed with contrary
orders and forced marches, for want of intelligence,
and from that indecision which must always be the consequence
of insufficient information. Many days were
spent in terror and in fruitless wishes for the English
fleet. One fact may mark the hurry and confusion of
the time; the cannon and the ball sent to Bantry Bay
were of different calibre. At last Ireland was providentially
saved by the change of wind, which prevented the
enemy from effecting a landing on her coast.</p>

<p>That the public will feel little interest in the danger
of an invasion of Ireland which might have happened
in the last century; that it can be of little consequence
to the public to hear how or why, twenty years ago, this or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
that man's telegraph was not established,&mdash;I am aware;
and I am sensible that few will care how cheaply it
might have been obtained, or will be greatly interested
in hearing of generous offers which were not accepted,
and patriotic exertions which were not permitted to be
of any national utility. I know that as a biographer I
am expected to put private feelings out of the question;
and this duty, as far as human nature will permit, I hope
I have performed.</p>

<p>The facts are stated from my own knowledge, and
from a more detailed account in his own "Letter to Lord
Charlemont on the Telegraph,"&mdash;a political pamphlet,
uncommon at least for its temperate and good-humored
tone.</p>

<p>Though all his exertions to establish a telegraph in Ireland
were at this time unsuccessful, yet he persevered in
the belief that in future modes of telegraphic communication
would be generally adopted; and instead of his
hopes being depressed, they were raised and expanded
by new consideration of the subject in a scientific light.
In the sixth volume of the "Transactions of the Royal
Irish Academy," he published an "Essay on the Art of Conveying
Swift and Secret Intelligence," in which he gives a
comprehensive view of the uses to which the system may
be applied, and a description, with plates, of his own
machinery. Accounts of his apparatus and specimens
of his vocabulary have been copied into various popular
publications, therefore it is sufficient here to refer to
them. The peculiar advantages of his machinery consist,
in the first place, in being as free from friction as
possible, consequently in its being easily moved, and not
easily destroyed by use; in the next place, on its being
simple, consequently easy to make and to repair. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
superior advantage of his vocabulary arises from its being
undecipherable. This depends on his employing the
numerical figures instead of the alphabet. With a power
of almost infinite change, and consequently with defiance
of detection, he applies the combination of numerical
figures to the words of a common dictionary, or to any
length of phrase in any given vocabulary. He was the
first who made this application of figures to telegraphic
communication.</p>

<p>Much has been urged by various modern claimants
for the honor of the invention of the telegraph. In
England the claims of Dr. Hooke and of the Marquis
of Worcester to the original idea are incontestable. But
the invention long lay dormant, till wakened into active
service by the French. Long before the French telegraph
appeared, my father had tried his first telegraphic
experiments. As he mentions in his own narrative, he
tried the use of windmill sails in 1767 in Berkshire; and
also a nocturnal telegraph with lamps and illuminated
letters, between London and Hampstead. He refers for
the confirmation of the facts to a letter of Mr. Perrot's,
a Berkshire gentleman who was with him at the time.
The original of this letter is now in my possession. It
was shown in 1795 to the President of the Royal Irish
Academy. The following is a copy of it:&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I perfectly recollect having several conversations
with you in 1767 on the subject of a speedy
and secret conveyance of intelligence. I recollect your
going up the hills to see how far and how distinctly the
arms (and the position of them) of Nettlebed Windmill
sails were to be discovered with ease.</p>

<p>As to the experiments from Highgate to London by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>means of lamps, I was not present at the time, but I
remember your mentioning the circumstance to me in
the same year. All these particulars were brought very
strongly to my memory when the French, some years ago,
conveyed intelligence by signals; and I then thought
and declared that the merit of the invention undoubtedly
belonged to you. I am very glad that I have it in my
power to send you this confirmation, because I imagine
there is no other person now living who can bear witness
to your observations in Berkshire.</p>

<p>I remain, dear Sir,</p>

<p class="center">Your affectionate friend,</p>

<p class="ralign"><span class="smcap">James L. Perrot</span>.</p>

<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">Bath</span>, Dec. 9, 1795.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Claims of priority of invention are always listened to
with doubt, or, at best, with impatience. To those who
bring the invention to perfection, who actually adapt it
to use, mankind are justly most grateful, and to these,
rather than to the original inventors, grant the honors
of a triumph. Sensible of this, the matter is urged no
farther, but left to the justice of posterity.</p>

<p>I am happy to state, however, one plain fact, which
stands independent of all controversy, that my father's
was the <i>first</i>, and I believe the only, telegraph which ever
spoke across the Channel from Ireland to Scotland. He
was, as he says in his essay on this subject, "ambitious
of being the first person who should connect the islands
more closely by facilitating their mutual intercourse;"
and on the 24th of August, 1794, my brothers had the
satisfaction of sending by my father's telegraph four messages
across the Channel, and of receiving immediate
answers, before a vast concourse of spectators.</p>

<span class="smcap">Edgeworthtown</span>, Dec. 11, 1794. &nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>

<p>I have been employed for two months in experiments
upon a telegraph of my own invention. I tried it partially
twenty-six years ago. It differs from the French in
distinctness and expedition, as the intelligence is not conveyed
alphabetically....</p>

<p>I intended to detail my telegraphs (in the plural),
but I find that I have not room at present. If you think
it worth while, you shall have the whole scheme before
you, which I know you will improve for me. Suffice it,
that by day, at eighteen or twenty miles' distance, I show,
by four pointers, isosceles triangles, twenty feet high, on
four imaginary circles, eight imaginary points, which correspond
with the figures</p>

<p class="center">0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>

<p class="ralign">
<span class="smcap">Derby</span>, March 15, 1795. &nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I beg your pardon for not immediately answering
your last favor, which was owing to the great influence
the evil demon has at present in all affairs on this
earth. That is, I lost your letter, and have in vain looked
over some scores of papers, and cannot find it. Sec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>ondly,
having lost your letter, I daily hoped to find it
again&mdash;without success.</p>

<p>The telegraph you described I dare say would answer
the purpose. It would be like a giant wielding his long
arms and talking with his fingers; and those long arms
might be covered with lamps in the night. You would
place four or six such gigantic figures in a line, so that
they should spell a whole word at once; and other such
figures in sight of each other, all round the coast of Ireland;
and thus fortify yourselves, instead of Friar Bacon's
wall of brass round England, with the brazen head, which
spoke, "Time is! Time was! Time is past!"</p>


<h3>MR. EDGEWORTH'S MACHINE.</h3>

<p>Having slightly mentioned the contrivances made use
of by the ancients for conveying intelligence swiftly, and
having pointed out some of the various important uses to
which this art may be applied, I shall endeavor to give a
clear view of my attempts on this subject.</p>

<p>Models of the French telegraph have been so often
exhibited, and the machine itself is so well known, that it
is not necessary to describe it minutely in this place. It
is sufficient to say that it consists of a tall pole, with three
movable arms, which may be seen at a considerable distance
through telescopes; these arms may be set in as
many different positions as are requisite to express all the
different letters of the alphabet. By a successive combination
of letters shown in this manner, words and sentences
are formed and intelligence communicated. No
doubt can be made of the utility of this machine, as it has
been applied to the most important purposes. It is ob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>viously
liable to mistakes, from the number of changes
requisite for each word, and from the velocity with which
it must be moved to convey intelligence with any tolerable
expedition.</p>

<p>The name, however, which is well chosen, has become
so familiar, that I shall, with a slight alteration, adopt it
for the apparatus which I am going to describe. <i>Telegraph</i>
is a proper name for a machine which describes
at a distance. <i>Telelograph</i>, or contractedly <i>Tellograph</i>, is
a proper name for a machine that describes <i>words</i> at a
distance.</p>

<p>Dr. Hooke, to whom every mechanic philosopher
must recur, has written an essay upon the subject of conveying
swift intelligence, in which he proposes to use large
wooden letters in succession. The siege of Vienna turned
his attention to the business. His method is more cumbrous
than the French telegraph, but far less liable to
error.</p>

<p>I tried it before I had seen Hooke's work, in the year
1767 in London, and I could distinctly read letters illuminated
with lamps in Hampstead Churchyard, from the
house of Mr. Elers in Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury, to
whom I refer for date and circumstance. To him and to
Mr. E. Delaval, F.R.S., to Mr. Perrot, of Hare Hatch,
and to Mr Woulfe the chemist, I refer for the precedency
which I claim in this invention. In that year I invented
the idea of my present tellograph, proposing to make use
of windmill sails instead of the hands or pointers which
I now employ. Mr. Perrot was so good as to accompany
me more than once to a hill near his house to observe
with a telescope the windmill at Nettlebed, which places
are, I think, sixteen miles asunder. My intention at that
time was to convey not only a swift but an unsuspected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
mode of intelligence. By means of common windmills
this might have been effected, before an account of the
French telegraph was made public.</p>

<p>My machinery consists of four triangular pointers or
hands [each upon a separate pedestal, ranged along in a
row], each of which points like the hand of a clock to different
situations in the circles which they describe. It
is easy to distinguish whether a hand moving vertically
points perpendicularly downwards or upwards, horizontally
to the right or left, or to any of the four intermediate
positions.</p>

<p>The eye can readily perceive the eight different positions
in which one of the pointers is represented [on the
plate attached to the article in the "Transactions," but here
omitted]. Of these eight positions seven only are employed
to denote figures, the upright position of the hand or pointer
being reserved to represent o, or zero. The figures thus
denoted refer to a vocabulary in which all the words are
numbered. Of the four pointers, that which appears to
the left hand of the observer represents thousands; the
others hundreds, tens, and units, in succession, as in common
numeration.</p>

<p>[By these means, as Mr. Edgeworth showed, numbers
from 1 up to 7,777, omitting those having a digit above 7,
could be displayed to the distant observer, who on referring
to his vocabulary discovered that they meant such
expressions as it might seem convenient to transmit by
this excellent invention.]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although the electric telegraphs have long since superseded
telegraphs of this class in public use, the young
people of Colonel Ingham's class took great pleasure in
the next summer in using Mr. Edgeworth's telegraph to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
communicate with each other, by plans easily made in
their different country homes.</p>

<p>It may interest the casual reader to know that the first
words in the first message transmitted on the telegraph
between Scotland and Ireland, alluded to above, were
represented by the numbers 2,645, 2,331, 573, 1,113
244, 2,411, 6,336, which being interpreted are,&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
"Hark from basaltic rocks and giant walls,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">and so on with the other lines, seven in number. This is
Mr. Edgeworth's concise history of telegraphy before his
time.</p>

<p>The art of conveying intelligence by sounds and signals
is of the highest antiquity. It was practised by Theseus in
the Argonautic expedition, by Agamemnon at the siege
of Troy, and by Mardonius in the time of Xerxes. It is
mentioned frequently in Thucydides. It was used by
Tamerlane, who had probably never heard of the black
sails of Theseus; by the Moors in Spain; by the Welsh
in Britain; by the Irish; and by the Chinese on that famous
wall by which they separated themselves from Tartary.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All this detail about Mr. Edgeworth's telegraph resulted
in much search in the older encyclop&aelig;dias. Quite full
accounts were found, by the young people, of his system,
and of the French system afterwards employed, and worked
in France until the electric telegraph made all such inventions
unnecessary.</p>

<p>Before the next meeting, Bedford Long, who lived on
Highland Street in Roxbury, and Hugh, who lived on
the side of Corey Hill, were able to communicate with
each other by semaphore; and at the next meeting they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
arranged two farther stations, so that John, at Cambridge,
and Jane Fortescue, at Lexington, were in the series.</p>

<p>There being some half an hour left that afternoon, the
children amused themselves by looking up some other of
Mr. Edgeworth's curious experiments and vagaries.</p>


<h3>MORE OF MR. EDGEWORTH'S FANCIES.</h3>

<p>During my residence at Hare Hatch another wager
was proposed by me among our acquaintance, the purport
of which was that I undertook to find a man who
should, with the assistance of machinery, walk faster than
any other person that could be produced. The machinery
which I intended to employ was a huge hollow wheel,
made very light, withinside of which, in a barrel of six feet
diameter, a man should walk. Whilst he stepped thirty
inches, the circumference of the large wheel, or rather
wheels, would revolve five feet on the ground; and as the
machinery was to roll on planks and on a plane somewhat
inclined, when once the <i>vis inerti&aelig;</i> of the machine should
be overcome, it would carry on the man within it as fast
as he could possibly walk. I had provided means of
regulating the motion, so that the wheel should not run
away with its master. I had the wheel made; and when
it was so nearly completed as to require but a few hours'
work to finish it, I went to London for Lord Effingham,
to whom I had promised that he should be present at the
first experiment made with it. But the bulk and extraordinary
appearance of my machine had attracted the notice
of the country neighborhood; and, taking advantage
of my absence, some idle curious persons went to the
carpenter I employed, who lived on Hare Hatch Com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>mon.
From him they obtained the great wheel which
had been left by me in his care. It was not finished.
I had not yet furnished it with the means of stopping
or moderating its motion. A young lad got into it; his
companions launched it on a path which led gently down
hill towards a very steep chalk-pit. This pit was at such
a distance as to be out of their thoughts when they set the
wheel in motion. On it ran. The lad withinside plied his
legs with all his might. The spectators, who at first stood
still to behold the operation, were soon alarmed by the
shouts of their companion, who perceived his danger. The
vehicle became quite ungovernable; the velocity increased
as it ran down hill. Fortunately the boy contrived to jump
from his rolling prison before it reached the chalk-pit; but
the wheel went on with such velocity as to outstrip its
pursuers, and, rolling over the edge of the precipice, it was
dashed to pieces.</p>

<p>The next day, when I came to look for my machine, intending
to try it on some planks which had been laid for
it, I found, to my no small disappointment, that the object
of all my labors and my hopes was lying at the bottom of
a chalk-pit, broken into a thousand pieces. I could not
at that time afford to construct another wheel of this sort,
and I cannot therefore determine what might have been
the success of my scheme.</p>

<p>As I am on the subject of carriages, I shall mention
a sailing-carriage that I tried on this common. The
carriage was light, steady, and ran with amazing velocity.
One day, when I was preparing for a sail in it with my
friend and schoolfellow Mr. William Foster, my wheel-boat
escaped from its moorings just as we were going to
step on board. With the utmost difficulty I overtook it;
and as I saw three or four stage-coaches on the road, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
feared that this sailing-chariot might frighten their horses,
I, at the hazard of my life, got into my carriage while it was
under full sail, and then, at a favorable part of the road, I
used the means I had of guiding it easily out of the way.
But the sense of the mischief which must have ensued if
I had not succeeded in getting into the machine at the
proper place and stopping it at the right moment was so
strong as to deter me from trying any more experiments
on this carriage in such a dangerous place.</p>

<p>Such should never be attempted except on a large common,
<i>at a distance from a high</i> road. It may not, however,
be amiss to suggest that upon a long extent of iron railway
in an open country carriages properly constructed
might make profitable voyages, from time to time, with
sails instead of horses; for though a constant or regular
intercourse could not be thus carried on, yet goods of a
certain sort, that are salable at any time, might be stored
till wind and weather were favorable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Bedford had read this passage, John Fordyce said
he had travelled hundreds of miles on the Western railways
where Mr. Edgeworth's sails could have been applied
without a "stage-coach" to be afraid of them.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<h3>JACK THE DARTER.</h3>

<p>In one of my journeys from Hare Hatch to Birmingham,
I accidentally met with a person whom I, as a mechanic,
had a curiosity to see. This was a sailor, who
had amused London with a singular exhibition of dexterity.
He was called <i>Jack the Darter</i>. He threw his darts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
which consisted of thin rods of deal of about half an inch
in diameter and of a yard long, to an amazing height and
distance; for instance, he threw them over what was then
called the New Church in the Strand. Of this feat I had
heard, but I entertained some doubts upon the subject.
I had inquired from my friends where this man could be
found, but had not been able to discover him. As I was
driving towards Birmingham in an open carriage of a singular
construction, I overtook a man who walked remarkably
fast, but who stopped as I passed him, and eyed my
equipage with uncommon curiosity. There was something
in his manner that made me speak to him; and
from the sort of questions he asked about my carriage, I
found that he was a clever fellow. I soon learned that he
had walked over the greatest part of England, and that he
was perfectly acquainted with London. It came into my
head to inquire whether he had ever seen the exhibition
about which I was so desirous to be informed.</p>

<p>"Lord! sir," said he, "I am myself Jack the Darter."
He had a roll of brown paper in his hand, which he
unfolded, and soon produced a bundle of the light deal
sticks which he had the power of darting to such a distance.
He readily consented to gratify my curiosity; and
after he had thrown some of them to a prodigious height,
I asked him to throw some of them horizontally. At the
first trial he threw one of them eighty yards with great
ease. I observed that he coiled a small string round the
stick, by which he gave it a rotary motion that preserved
it from altering its course; and at the same time it allowed
the arm which threw it time to exercise its whole force.</p>

<p>If anything be simply thrown from the hand, it is clear
that it can acquire no greater velocity than that of the
hand that throws it; but if the body that is thrown passes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
through a greater space than the hand, whilst the hand
continues to communicate motion to the body to be impelled,
the body will acquire a velocity nearly double to
that of the hand which throws it. The ancients were
aware of this; and they wrapped a thong of leather round
their javelins, by which they could throw them with additional
violence. This invention did not, I believe, belong
to the Greeks; nor do I remember its being mentioned
by Homer or Xenophon. It was in use among the Romans,
but at what time it was introduced or laid aside I
know not. Whoever is acquainted with the science of
projectiles will perceive that this invention is well worthy
of their attention.</p>


<hr class='tb' />

<h3>A ONE-WHEELED CHAISE.</h3>

<p>After having satisfied my curiosity about Jack the
Darter, I proceeded to Birmingham. I mentioned that I
travelled in a carriage of a singular construction. It was
a one-wheeled chaise, which I had had made for the purpose
of going conveniently in narrow roads. It was made
fast by shafts to the horse's sides, and was furnished with two
weights or counterpoises, that hung below the shafts. The
seat was not more than eight and twenty or thirty inches
from the ground, in order to bring the centre of gravity
of the whole as low as possible. The footboard turned
upon hinges fastened to the shafts, so that when it met
with any obstacle it gave way, and my legs were warned
to lift themselves up. In going through water my legs
were secured by leathers, which folded up like the sides
of bellows; by this means I was pretty safe from wet. On<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
my road to Birmingham I passed through Long Compton,
in Warwickshire, on a Sunday. The people were returning
from church, and numbers stopped to gaze at me.
There is, or was, a shallow ford near the town, over which
there was a very narrow bridge for horse and foot passengers,
but not sufficiently wide for wagons or chaises.
Towards this bridge I drove. The people, not perceiving
the structure of my one-wheeled vehicle, called to me with
great eagerness to warn me that the bridge was too narrow
for carriages. I had an excellent horse, which went
so fast as to give but little time for examination. The
louder they called, the faster I drove; and when I had
passed the bridge, they shouted after me with surprise. I
got on to Shipstone upon Stone; but before I had dined
there I found that my fame had overtaken me. My carriage
was put into a coach-house, so that those who came
from Long Compton, not seeing it, did not recognize me.
I therefore had an opportunity of hearing all the exaggerations
and strange conjectures which were made by those
who related my passage over the narrow bridge. There
were posts on the bridge, to prevent, as I suppose, more
than one horseman from passing at once. Some of the
spectators asserted that my carriage had gone over these
posts; others said that it had not wheels, which was indeed
literally true; but they meant to say that it was
without any wheel. Some were sure that no carriage
ever went so fast; and all agreed that at the end of the
bridge, where the floods had laid the road for some way
under water, my carriage swam on the surface of the
water.</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII.<br /><br />

<small>JAMES WATT.</small></h2>


<p>"Uncle Fritz," said Mabel Liddell, the next afternoon
that our friends had gathered together for a
reading, "would it not be well for us all to go down into
the kitchen this afternoon, and watch the steam come out
of the kettle as Ellen makes tea for us?"</p>

<p>"Why should it be well, Mabel?" said Colonel Ingham.
"For my part, I should prefer to remain in my own
room, more especially as I consider my armchair to be
more suited to the comfort of one already on the downward
path in life than is the kitchen table, where we should
have to sit should we invade the premises of our friends
below."</p>

<p>"I was thinking," said Mabel, "of the manner in which
James Watt when a child invented the steam-engine,
from observing the motion of the top of the teakettle;
and as we are to read about Watt this afternoon I thought
we might be in a more fit condition to understand his
invention, and might more fully comprehend his frame of
mind while perfecting his great work, should we also fix
our eyes and minds on the top of the teakettle in Ellen's
kitchen."</p>

<p>"Mabel, my child," said Uncle Fritz, "you talk like
a book, and a very interesting one at that; but I think,
as the youngest of us would say, that you are just a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
off in your remarks. And as I observe that Clem, who is
going to read this afternoon, desires to deliver a sermon
of which your conversation seems to be the text, I will
request all to listen to him before we consider seriously
vacating this apartment, however poor it may be,"&mdash;and
he glanced fondly around at the comfortable arrangements
that everywhere pervaded the study,&mdash;"and seek the
regions below."</p>

<p>"I only wanted to say," began Clem, "that although
Watt did on one occasion (in his extreme youth) look at a
teakettle with some interest, he was not in the habit, at the
time when he devoted most thought to the steam-engine,
of having a teakettle continually before him that he might
gain inspiration from observing the steam issue from its
nose. And, as Watt dispensed with this aid, I have no
doubt that we may do so as well, contenting ourselves
with the results of the experiments in the vaporization of
water, which Ellen is now conducting in the form of tea.
Besides all this, however, I do want to say some things,
before we read aloud this afternoon (I hope this isn't
really too much like a sermon), about the steam-engine
and the part that Watt had in perfecting it."</p>

<p>At this point the irrepressible Mabel was heard to whisper
to Bedford, who sat next her: "Wasn't it curious that
the same mind which grasped the immense capabilities
of the steam-engine should have been able also to construct
such a delicate lyric as</p>

<p class="poem">
'How doth the little busy bee<br />
Improve each shining hour'?"<br />
</p>

<p>"Mabel," said Colonel Ingham, "you are absolutely
unbearable. If you do not keep in better order I shall be
sorry that I dissuaded you from descending to the kitchen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
I see nothing incongruous myself in indulging in mechanical
experiments, and in throwing one's thoughts into the
form of verse,"&mdash;here the old gentleman colored slightly,
as though he recollected something of the sort,&mdash;"but it
may be well to counteract the impression your conversation
may have made by stating that Isaac Watts did not invent
the steam-engine, nor did James Watt write the beautiful
words you have just quoted.&mdash;Now, Clem, I believe you
have the floor."</p>

<p>"Well," said Clem, "I only want the floor for a short
time in order to explain about Watt and the steam-engine,
and how much he was the inventor of it, before we begin
to read.</p>

<p>"There are various points about the steam-engine which
are really Watt's invention,&mdash;the separate condenser,
for instance,&mdash;but the idea of the steam-engine was not
original with him; that is, when he saw the steam in the
teakettle raise the lid and drop it again, he was not the
first to speculate on the power of steam."</p>

<p>"Are you going to read us that part in the book, Clem?"
asked Bedford, with some interest.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you like," said Clem. "I guess it tells about it
in Mr. Smiles's 'Life of Watt.'" So he began to overhaul
the book he had brought, and shortly discovered the
anecdote referred to by Mabel with such interest, and
read it.</p>

<p>"On one occasion he [James Watt] was reproved by
Mrs. Muirhead, his aunt, for his indolence at the tea-table.
'James Watt,' said the worthy lady, 'I never saw such
an idle boy as you are. Take a book, or employ yourself
usefully; for the last hour you have not spoken one word,
but taken off the lid of that kettle and put it on again,
holding now a cup and now a silver spoon over the steam,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
watching how it rises from the spout, catching and counting
the drops it falls into.' In the view of M. Arago,
the little James before the teakettle, becomes the great
engineer, preparing the discoveries which were soon to
immortalize him. In our opinion, the judgment of the
aunt was the truest. There is no reason to suppose that
the mind of the boy was occupied with philosophical theories
on the condensation of steam, which he compassed
with so much difficulty in his maturer years. This is more
probably an afterthought borrowed from his subsequent
discoveries. Nothing is commoner than for children to
be amused with such phenomena in the same way that
they will form air-bubbles in a cup of tea, and watch them
sailing over the surface till they burst. The probability is
that little James was quite as idle as he seemed."</p>

<p>"That is very interesting," remarked Mabel. "Don't
you think now, Uncle Fritz, we had better go into the
kitchen?" And she looked appealingly at the old gentleman,
who merely held up his finger for silence as Clem
continued his lecture.</p>

<p>"What I meant to say," Clem went on, "was that other
people before Watt had found out the power of steam, and
had used it too. There was one Hero of Alexandria, who
lived about two thousand years ago, who used steam for
many interesting purposes, notably for animating various
figures that took part in the idolatrous worship of his time,
and thus in deceiving the common people. But his contrivances,
though engines which went by steam, would
hardly be called steam-engines. Between Hero of Alexandria,
of 160 <span class="smcap">b. c.</span>, and the Marquis of Worcester, of
1650 <span class="smcap">a. d.</span>, there does not seem to have been much doing
in the way of inventing the steam-engine. But the Marquis
of Worcester in Charles II.'s time was a great phi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>losopher,
and did nobody knows exactly what with steam.
But though he did great things, he did not produce a
particularly capable engine, though he seems to have
known more about steam than anybody else did at his
time. After the Marquis of Worcester and before Watt,
there were three men who did much towards inventing
and improving the steam-engine. Their names were
Savery, Papin, and Newcomen. I don't propose to
tell you about the inventions of each one; but it's
well enough to remember that each one did important
service in getting the steam-engine to the point where
Watt took hold of it. As it was on Newcomen's engine
that Watt made his first serious experiments, I think we
should all like to know something about it."</p>


<h3>THE NEWCOMEN ENGINE.</h3>

<p>Newcomen's engine may be thus briefly described: The
steam was generated in a separate boiler, as in Savery's
engine, from which it was conveyed into a vertical cylinder
underneath a piston fitting it closely, but movable
upwards and downwards through its whole length. The
piston was fixed to a rod, which was attached by a joint
or chain to the end of a lever vibrating upon an axis, the
other end being attached to a rod working a pump.
When the piston in the cylinder was raised, steam was
let into the vacated space through a tube fitted into the
top of the boiler, and mounted with a stopcock. The
pump-rod at the further end of the lever being thus depressed,
cold water was applied to the sides of the cylinder,
on which the steam within it was condensed, a
vacuum was produced, and the external air, pressing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
upon the top of the piston, forced it down into the empty
cylinder. The pump-rod was thereby raised; and, the
operation of depressing it being repeated, a power was
thus produced which kept the pump continuously at work.
Such, in a few words, was the construction and action of
Newcomen's first engine.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>While the engine was still in its trial state, a curious accident
occurred which led to a change in the mode of
condensation, and proved of essential importance in establishing
Newcomen's engine as a practical working
power. The accident was this: in order to keep the cylinder
as free from air as possible, great pains were taken
to prevent it passing down by the side of the piston, which
was carefully wrapped with cloth or leather; and, still
further to keep the cylinder air-tight, a quantity of water
was kept constantly on the upper side of the piston. At
one of the early trials the inventors were surprised to
see the engine make several strokes in unusually quick
succession; and on searching for the cause, they found it
to consist in <i>a hole in the piston</i>, which had let the cold
water in a jet into the inside of the cylinder, and thereby
produced a rapid vacuum by the condensation of the
continued steam. A new light suddenly broke upon
Newcomen. The idea of condensing by injection of cold
water directly into the cylinder, instead of applying it on
the outside, at once occurred to him; and he proceeded
to embody the expedient which had thus been accidentally
suggested as part of his machine. The result was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the addition of the injection pipe, through which, when
the piston was raised and the cylinder full of steam, a jet
of cold water was thrown in, and, the steam being suddenly
condensed, the piston was at once driven down by
the pressure of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>An accident of a different kind shortly after led to the
improvement of Newcomen's engine in another respect.
To keep it at work, one man was required to attend the
fire, and another to turn alternately the two cocks, one
admitting the steam into the cylinder, the other admitting
the jet of cold water to condense it. The turning of these
cocks was easy work, usually performed by a boy. It was,
however, a very monotonous duty, though requiring constant
attention. To escape the drudgery and obtain an
interval for rest or perhaps for play, a boy named
Humphrey Potter, who turned the cocks, set himself to
discover some method of evading his task. He must
have been an ingenious boy, as is clear from the arrangement
he contrived with this object. Observing the alternate
ascent and descent of the beam above his head, he
bethought him of applying the movement to the alternate
raising and lowering of the levers which governed the
cocks. The result was the contrivance of what he called
the <i>scoggan</i> (meaning presumably the loafer or lazy boy),
consisting of a catch worked by strings from the beam of
the engine. This arrangement, when tried, was found to
answer the purpose intended. The action of the engine
was thus made automatic; and the arrangement, though
rude, not only enabled Potter to enjoy his play, but it had
the effect of improving the working power of the engine
itself; the number of strokes which it made being increased
from six or eight to fifteen or sixteen in the minute.
This invention was afterward greatly improved by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Mr. Henry Beighton, of Newcastle-on-Tyne, who added
the plug-rod and hand-gear. He did away with the
catches and strings of the boy Potter's rude apparatus,
and substituted a rod suspended from the beam, which
alternately opened and shut the tappets attached to the
steam and injection cocks.</p>

<p>Thus, step by step, Newcomen's engine grew in power
and efficiency, and became more and more complete as a
self-acting machine. It will be observed that, like all
other inventions, it was not the product of any one man's
ingenuity, but of many. One contributed one improvement,
and another another. The essential features of the
atmospheric engine were not new. The piston and cylinder
had been known as long ago as the time of Hero.
The expansive force of steam and the creation of a vacuum
by its condensation had been known to the Marquis
of Worcester, Savery, Papin, and many more. Newcomen
merely combined in his machine the result of their varied
experience; and, assisted by the persons who worked with
him, down to the engine-boy Potter, he advanced the invention
several important stages; so that the steam-engine
was no longer a toy or a scientific curiosity, but had become
a powerful machine capable of doing useful work.</p>


<h3>JAMES WATT AND THE STEAM-ENGINE.</h3>

<p>It was in the year 1759 that Robison<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> first called the
attention of his friend Watt to the subject of the steam-engine.
Robison was then only in his twentieth, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>Watt in his twenty-third year. Robison's idea was that
the power of steam might be advantageously applied to
the driving of wheel-carriages; and he suggested that it
would be the most convenient for the purpose to place
the cylinder with its open end downwards to avoid the
necessity of using a working-beam. Watt admits that he
was very ignorant of the steam-engine at the time; nevertheless,
he began making a model with two cylinders of
tin plate, intending that the pistons and their connecting-rods
should act alternately on two pinions attached to the
axles of the carriage-wheels. But the model, being slightly
and inaccurately made, did not answer his expectations.
Other difficulties presented themselves, and the scheme
was laid aside because Robison left Glasgow to go to sea.
Indeed, mechanical science was not yet ripe for the locomotive.
Robison's idea had, however, dropped silently
into the mind of his friend, where it grew from day to day,
slowly and at length fruitfully.</p>

<p>At his intervals of leisure and in the quiet of his evenings,
Watt continued to prosecute his various studies. He
was shortly attracted by the science of chemistry, then in
its infancy. Dr. Black was at that time occupied with the
investigations which led to his discovery of the theory of
latent heat, and it is probable that his familiar conversations
with Watt on the subject induced the latter to enter upon
a series of experiments with the view of giving the theory
some practical direction. His attention again and again
reverted to the steam-engine, though he had not yet seen
even a model of one. Steam was as yet almost unknown
in Scotland as a working power. The first engine was
erected at Elphinstone Colliery, in Stirlingshire, about the
year 1750; and the second more than ten years later, at
Govan Colliery, near Glasgow, where it was known by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
startling name of "The Firework." This had not, however,
been set up at the time Watt had begun to inquire
into the subject. But he found that the college possessed
the model of a Newcomen engine for the use of the Natural
Philosophy class, which had been sent to London for
repair. On hearing of its existence, he suggested to his
friend Dr. Anderson, Professor of Natural Philosophy, the
propriety of getting back the model; and a sum of money
was placed by the Senatus at the professor's disposal, "to
recover the steam-engine from Mr. Sisson, instrument-maker
in London."</p>

<p>In the mean time Watt sought to learn all that had been
written on the subject of the steam-engine. He ascertained
from Desaguliers, Switzer, and other writers, what
had been accomplished by Savery, Newcomen, Beighton,
and others; and he went on with his own independent
experiments. His first apparatus was of the simplest possible
kind. He used common apothecaries' phials for his
steam reservoirs, and canes hollowed out for his steam-pipes.
In 1761 he proceeded to experiment on the force
of steam by means of a small Papin's digester and a syringe.
The syringe was only the third of an inch in diameter, fitted
with a solid piston; and it was connected with the digester
by a pipe furnished with a stopcock, by which the steam
was admitted or shut off at will. It was also itself provided
with a stopcock, enabling a communication to be opened
between the syringe and the outer air to permit the steam
in the syringe to escape. The apparatus, though rude,
enabled the experimenter to ascertain some important
facts. When the steam in the digester was raised and the
cock turned, enabling it to rush against the lower side of
the piston, he found that the expansive force of the steam
raised a weight of fifteen pounds, with which the piston<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
was loaded. Then on turning on the cock and shutting off
the connection with the digester at the same time that a
passage was opened to the air, the steam was allowed to
escape, when the weight upon the piston, being no longer
counteracted, immediately forced it to descend.</p>

<p>Watt saw that it would be easy to contrive that the
cocks should be turned by the machinery itself with perfect
regularity. But there was an objection to this method.
Water is converted into vapor as soon as its elasticity is
sufficient to overcome the weight of the air which keeps it
down. Under the ordinary pressure of the atmosphere
water acquires this necessary elasticity at 212&deg;; but as the
steam in the digester was prevented from escaping, it acquired
increased heat, and by consequence increased elasticity.
Hence it was that the steam which issued from the
digester was not only able to support the piston and the
air which pressed upon its upper surface, but the additional
load with which the piston was weighted. With the imperfect
mechanical construction, however, of those days,
there was a risk lest the boiler should be burst by the
steam, which was apt to force its way through the ill-made
joints of the machine. This, conjoined with the great expenditure
of steam on the high-pressure system, led Watt
to abandon the plan; and the exigencies of his business
for a time prevented him from pursuing his experiments.</p>

<p>At length the Newcomen model arrived from London;
and in 1763 the little engine, which was destined to become
so famous, was put into the hands of Watt. The
boiler was somewhat smaller than an ordinary teakettle.
The cylinder of the engine was only of two inches diameter
and six inches stroke. Watt at first regarded it as merely
"a fine plaything." It was, however, enough to set him
upon a track of thinking which led to the most important<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
results. When he had repaired the model and set it to
work, he found that the boiler, though apparently large
enough, could not supply steam in sufficient quantity, and
only a few strokes of the piston could be obtained, when
the engine stopped. The fire was urged by blowing, and
more steam was produced; but still it would not work
properly. Exactly at the point at which another man
would have abandoned the task in despair, the mind of
Watt became thoroughly roused. "Everything," says
Professor Robison, "was to him the beginning of a new
and serious study; and I knew that he would not quit it
till he had either discovered its insignificance or had made
something of it." Thus it happened with the phenomena
presented by the model of the steam-engine. Watt referred
to his books, and endeavored to ascertain from them
by what means he might remedy the defects which he
found in the model; but they could tell him nothing. He
then proceeded with an independent course of experiments,
resolved to work out the problem for himself. In
the course of his inquiries he came upon a fact which,
more than any other, led his mind into the train of thought
which at last conducted him to the invention of which the
results were destined to prove so stupendous. This fact
was the existence of latent heat.</p>

<p>In order to follow the track of investigation pursued by
Watt, it is necessary for a moment to revert to the action
of the Newcomen pumping-engine. A beam, moving
upon a centre, had affixed to one end of it a chain attached
to the piston of the pump, and at the other a chain attached
to a piston that fitted into the steam-cylinder. It
was by driving this latter piston up and down the cylinder
that the pump was worked. To communicate the necessary
movement to the piston, the steam generated in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
boiler was admitted to the bottom of the cylinder, forcing
out the air through a valve, where its pressure on the under
side of the piston counterbalanced the pressure of the atmosphere
on its upper side. The piston, thus placed between
two equal forces, was drawn up to the top of the
cylinder by the greater weight of the pump-gear at the
opposite extremity of the beam. The steam, so far, only
discharged the office of the air it displaced; but if the air
had been allowed to remain, the piston once at the top of
the cylinder could not have returned, being pressed as
much by the atmosphere underneath as by the atmosphere
above it. The steam, on the contrary, which was admitted
by the exclusion of air, <i>could be condensed</i>, and a vacuum
created, by injecting cold water through the bottom of the
cylinder. The piston, being now unsupported, was forced
down by the pressure of the atmosphere on its upper surface.
When the piston reached the bottom, the steam was
again let in, and the process was repeated. Such was the
engine in ordinary use for pumping water at the time that
Watt began his investigations.</p>

<p>Among his other experiments, he constructed a boiler
which showed by inspection the quantity of water evaporated
in any given time, and the quantity of steam used
in every stroke of the engine. He was astonished to discover
that a <i>small</i> quantity of water in the form of steam
heated a large quantity of cold water injected into the
cylinder for the purpose of cooling it; and upon further
examination he ascertained that steam heated six times
its weight of cold water to 212&deg;, which was the temperature
of the steam itself. "Being struck with this remarkable
fact," says Watt, "and not understanding the reason
of it, I mentioned it to my friend Dr. Black, who then
explained to me his doctrine of latent heat, which he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
taught for some time before this period (the summer of
1764); but having myself been occupied by the pursuits
of business, if I had heard of it I had not attended to it,
when I thus stumbled upon one of the material facts by
which that beautiful theory is supported."</p>

<p>When Watt found that water in its conversion into
vapor became such a reservoir of heat, he was more
than ever bent on economizing it; for the great waste of
heat involving so heavy a consumption of fuel was felt to
be the principal obstacle to the extended employment of
steam as a motive power. He accordingly endeavored,
with the same quantity of fuel, at once to increase the
production of steam and to diminish its waste. He
increased the heating surface of the boiler by making
flues through it; he even made his boiler of wood, as
being a worse conductor of heat than the brickwork
which surrounds common furnaces; and he cased the
cylinders and all the conducting pipes in materials which
conducted heat very slowly. But none of these contrivances
were effectual; for it turned out that the chief
expenditure of steam, and consequently of fuel, in the
Newcomen engine, was occasioned by the reheating of
the cylinder after the steam had been condensed, and
the cylinder was consequently cooled by the injection
into it of the cold water. Nearly four fifths of the whole
steam employed was condensed on its first admission,
before the surplus could act upon the piston. Watt
therefore came to the conclusion that to make a perfect
steam-engine it was necessary that <i>the cylinder should be
always as hot as the steam that entered it</i>; but it was
equally necessary that the steam should be condensed
when the piston descended, nay, that it should be
cooled down below 100&deg;, or a considerable amount of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
vapor would be given off, which would resist the descent
of the piston, and diminish the power of the engine.
Thus the cylinder was never to be at a less temperature
than 212&deg;, and yet at each descent of the piston it was to
be less than 100&deg;,&mdash;conditions which, on the very face
of them, seemed to be wholly incompatible.</p>

<p>Though still occupied with his inquiries and experiments
as to steam, Watt did not neglect his proper
business, but was constantly on the look-out for improvements
in instrument-making. A machine which he
invented for drawing in perspective proved a success;
and he made a considerable number of them to order,
for customers in London as well as abroad. He was
also an indefatigable reader, and continued to extend
his knowledge of chemistry and mechanics by perusal
of the best books on these sciences.</p>

<p>Above all subjects, however, the improvement of the
steam-engine continued to keep the fastest hold upon
his mind. He still brooded over his experiments with
the Newcomen model, but did not seem to make much
way in introducing any practical improvement in its mode
of working. His friend Robison says he struggled long
to condense with sufficient rapidity without injection,
trying one experiment after another, finding out what
would <i>not</i> do, and exhibiting many beautiful specimens
of ingenuity and fertility of resource. He continued, to
use his own words, "to grope in the dark, misled by
many an <i>ignis fatuus</i>." It was a favorite saying of
his that "Nature has a weak side, if we can only find
it out;" and he went on groping and feeling for it,
but as yet in vain. At length light burst upon him,
and all at once the problem over which he had been
brooding was solved.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE SEPARATE CONDENSER.</h3>

<p>One Sunday afternoon, in the spring of 1765, he went
to take an afternoon walk on the Green, then a quiet
grassy meadow used as a bleaching and grazing ground.
On week days the Glasgow lasses came thither with their
largest kail-pots to boil their clothes in; and sturdy
queans might be seen, with coats kilted, trampling blankets
in their tubs. On Sundays the place was comparatively
deserted; and hence Watt, who lived close at hand,
went there to take a quiet afternoon stroll. His thoughts
were as usual running on the subject of his unsatisfactory
experiments with the Newcomen engine, when the first
idea of the separate condenser suddenly flashed upon
his mind. But the notable discovery is best told in his
own words, as related to Mr. Robert Hart, many years
after:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I had gone to take a walk on a fine Sabbath afternoon.
I had entered the Green by the gate at the foot of
Charlotte Street, and had passed the old washing-house.
I was thinking upon the engine at the time, and had gone
as far as the herd's house, when the idea came into my
mind that as the steam was an elastic body, it would rush
into a vacuum, and if a communication were made between
the cylinder and an exhausted vessel, it would rush
into it and might be then condensed without cooling the
cylinder. I then saw that I must get rid of the condensed
steam and the injection water if I used a jet, as in Newcomen's
engine. Two ways of doing this occurred to me.
First, the water might be run off by a descending pipe, if
an off-let could be got at the depth of 35 or 36 feet, and
any air might be extracted by a small pump. The second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
was to make the pump large enough to extract both water
and air." He continued: "I had not walked farther than
the Golf-house when the whole thing was arranged in my
mind."</p>

<p>Great and prolific ideas are almost always simple.
What seems impossible at the outset appears so obvious
when it is effected, that we are prone to marvel that it did
not force itself at once upon the mind. Late in life Watt,
with his accustomed modesty, declared his belief that if
he had excelled, it had been by chance, and the neglect
of others. To Professor Jardine he said that when it
was analyzed the invention would not appear so great as
it seemed to be. "In the state," said he, "in which I
found the steam-engine, it was no great effort of mind to
observe that the quantity of fuel necessary to make it
work would forever prevent its extensive utility. The
next step in my progress was equally easy,&mdash;to inquire
what was the cause of the great consumption of fuel: this,
too, was readily suggested, viz., the waste of fuel which
was necessary to bring the whole cylinder, piston, and
adjacent parts from the coldness of water to the heat of
steam, no fewer than from fifteen to twenty times in a
minute." The question then occurred, How was this to
be avoided or remedied? It was at this stage that the
idea of carrying on the condensation in a separate vessel
flashed upon his mind, and solved the difficulty.</p>

<p>Mankind has been more just to Watt than he was to
himself. There was no accident in the discovery. It had
been the result of close and continuous study; and the
idea of the separate condenser was merely the last step of
a long journey, a step which could not have been taken
unless the road which led to it had been traversed.
Dr. Black says, "This capital improvement flashed upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
his mind at once, and filled him with rapture,"&mdash;a statement
which, in spite of the unimpassioned nature of Watt,
we can readily believe.</p>

<p>On the morning following his Sunday afternoon's walk
on Glasgow Green, Watt was up betimes, making arrangements
for a speedy trial of his new plan. He borrowed
from a college friend a large brass syringe, an inch and a
third in diameter, and ten inches long, of the kind used
by anatomists for injecting arteries with wax previous to
dissection. The body of the syringe served for a cylinder,
the piston-rod passing through a collar of leather in its
cover. A pipe connected with the boiler was inserted at
both ends for the admission of steam, and at the upper
end was another pipe to convey the steam to the condenser.
The axis of the stem of the piston was drilled with a
hole, fitted with a valve at its lower end, to permit the
water produced by the condensed steam on first filling the
cylinder to escape. The first condenser made use of was
an improvised cistern of tinned plate, provided with a
pump to get rid of the water formed by the condensation
of the steam, both the condensing-pipes and the air-pump
being placed in a reservoir of cold water.</p>

<p>"The steam-pipe," says Watt, "was adjusted to a small
boiler. When the steam was produced, it was admitted
into the cylinder, and soon issued through the perforation
of the rod and at the valve of the condenser; when it was
judged that the air was expelled, the steam-cock was shut,
and the air-pump piston-rod was drawn up, which leaving
the small pipes of the condenser in a state of vacuum, the
steam entered them, and was condensed. The piston of
the cylinder immediately rose, and lifted a weight of about
eighteen pounds, which was hung to the lower end of the
piston-rod. The exhaustion-cock was shut, the steam was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
re-admitted into the cylinder, and the operation was repeated.
The quantity of steam consumed and the weights
it could raise were observed, and, excepting the non-application
of the steam-case and external covering, the invention
was complete in so far as regarded the savings
of steam and fuel."</p>


<h3>COMPLETING THE INVENTION.</h3>

<p>But although the invention was complete in Watt's
mind, it took him many long and laborious years to work
out the details of the engine. His friend Robison, with
whom his intimacy was maintained during these interesting
experiments, has given a graphic account of the difficulties
which he successively encountered and overcame. He
relates that on his return from the country, after the college
vacation in 1765, he went to have a chat with Watt
and communicate to him some observations he had made
on Desaguliers' and Belidor's account of the steam-engine.
He went straight into the parlor, without ceremony, and
found Watt sitting before the fire looking at a little tin cistern
which he had on his knee. Robison immediately
started the conversation about steam; his mind, like Watt's,
being occupied with the means of avoiding the excessive
waste of heat in the Newcomen engine. Watt all the
while kept looking into the fire, and after a time laid down
the cistern at the foot of his chair, saying nothing. It
seems that Watt felt rather nettled that Robison had
communicated to a mechanic of the town a contrivance
which he had hit upon for turning the cocks of his engine.
When Robison therefore pressed his inquiry, Watt at
length looked at him and said briskly, "You need not fash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
yourself any more about that, man. I have now made an
engine that shall not waste a particle of steam. It shall
all be boiling hot,&mdash;ay, and hot water injected, if I
please." He then pushed the little tin cistern with his
foot under the table.</p>

<p>Robison could learn no more of the new contrivance
from Watt at that time; but on the same evening he accidentally
met a mutual acquaintance, who, supposing he
knew as usual the progress of Watt's experiments, observed
to him, "Well, have you seen Jamie Watt?" "Yes."
"He'll be in fine spirits now with his engine?" "Yes,"
said Robison, "very fine spirits." "Gad!" said the
other, "the separate condenser's the thing; keep it but
cold enough, and you may have a perfect vacuum, whatever
be the heat of the cylinder." This was Watt's secret,
and the nature of the contrivance was clear to Robison
at once.</p>

<p>It will be observed that Watt had not made a secret of
it to his other friends. Indeed, Robison himself admitted
that one of Watt's greatest delights was to communicate
the results of his experiments to others, and set them upon
the same road to knowledge with himself; and that no
one could display less of the small jealousy of the tradesman
than he did. To his intimate friend Dr. Black he
communicated the progress made by him at every stage.
The Doctor kindly encouraged him in his struggles,
cheered him in his encounter with difficulty, and, what
was of still more practical value at the time, helped him
with money to enable him to prosecute his invention.
Communicative though Watt was disposed to be, he learnt
reticence when he found himself exposed to the depredations
of the smaller fry of inventors. Robison says that
had he lived in Birmingham or London at the time, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
probability is that some one or other of the numerous harpies
who live by sucking other people's brains would have
secured patents for his more important inventions, and
thereby deprived him of the benefits of his skill, science,
and labor. As yet, however, there were but few mechanics
in Glasgow capable of understanding or appreciating
the steam-engine; and the intimate friends to whom he
freely spoke of his discovery were too honorable to take
advantage of his confidence. Shortly after Watt communicated
to Robison the different stages of his invention,
and the results at which he had arrived, much to the
delight of his friend.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that in the Newcomen engine
the steam was only employed for the purpose of producing
a vacuum, and that its working power was in the
down stroke, which was effected by the pressure of the
air upon the piston; hence it is now usual to call it the atmospheric
engine. Watt perceived that the air which followed
the piston down the cylinder would cool the latter,
and that steam would be wasted by reheating it. In order,
therefore, to avoid this loss of heat, he resolved to
put an air-tight cover upon the cylinder, with a hole and
stuffing-box for the piston-rod to slide through, and to
admit steam above the piston, to act upon it instead
of the atmosphere. When the steam had done its duty
in driving down the piston, a communication was opened
between the upper and lower part of the cylinder; and the
same steam, distributing itself equally in both compartments,
sufficed to restore equilibrium. The piston was
now drawn up by the weight of the pump-gear; the steam
beneath it was then condensed in the separate vessel
so as to produce a vacuum, and a fresh jet of steam
from the boiler was let in above the piston, which forced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
it again to the bottom of the cylinder. From an atmospheric
engine it had thus become a true steam-engine, and
with much greater economy of steam than when the air
did half the duty. But it was not only important to keep
the air from flowing down the inside of the cylinder; the
air which circulated within cooled the metal and condensed
a portion of the steam within; and this Watt proposed
to remedy by a second cylinder, surrounding the
first, with an interval between the two which was to be
kept full of steam.</p>

<p>One by one these various contrivances were struck out,
modified, settled, and reduced to definite plans,&mdash;the separate
condenser, the air and water pumps, the use of fat
and oil (instead of water, as in the Newcomen engine) to
keep the piston working in the cylinder air-tight, and the
enclosing of the cylinder itself within another to prevent
the loss of heat. These were all emanations from the first
idea of inventing an engine working by a piston, in which
the cylinder should be continually hot and perfectly
dry. "When once," says Watt, "the idea of separate
condensation was started, all these improvements followed
as corollaries in quick succession, so that in the course
of one or two days the invention was thus far complete in
my mind."</p>


<h3>WATT MAKES HIS MODEL.</h3>

<p>The next step was to construct a model engine for the
purpose of embodying the invention in a working form.
With this object, Watt hired an old cellar, situated in the
first wide entry to the north of the beef-market in King
Street, and then proceeded with his model. He found it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
much easier, however, to prepare his plan than to execute
it. Like most ingenious and inventive men, Watt was extremely
fastidious; and this occasioned considerable delay
in the execution of the work. His very inventiveness to
some extent proved a hindrance; for new expedients were
perpetually occurring to him, which he thought would be
improvements, and which he, by turns, endeavored to
introduce. Some of these expedients he admits proved
fruitless, and all of them occasioned delay. Another of
his chief difficulties was in finding competent workmen to
execute his plans. He himself had been accustomed only
to small metal work, with comparatively delicate tools,
and had very little experience "in the practice of mechanics
<i>in great</i>" as he termed it. He was therefore
under the necessity of depending, in a great measure,
upon the handiwork of others. But mechanics capable
of working out Watt's designs in metal were then with
difficulty to be found. The beautiful self-action and
workmanship which have since been called into being,
principally by his own invention, did not then exist.
The only available hands in Glasgow were the blacksmiths
and tinners, little capable of constructing articles
out of their ordinary walks; and even in these they
were often found clumsy, blundering, and incompetent.
The result was, that in consequence of the malconstruction
of the larger parts, Watt's first model was only partially
successful. The experiments made with it, however,
served to verify the expectations he had formed, and to
place the advantages of the invention beyond the reach of
doubt. On the exhausting-cock being turned, the piston,
when loaded with eighteen pounds, ascended as quickly
as the blow of a hammer; and the moment the steam-cock
was opened, it descended with like rapidity, though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
the steam was weak, and the machine snifted at many
openings.</p>

<p>Satisfied that he had laid hold of the right principle of
a working steam-engine, Watt felt impelled to follow it to
an issue. He could give his mind to no other business
in peace until this was done. He wrote to a friend that
he was quite barren on every other subject. "My whole
thoughts," said he, "are bent on this machine. I can
think of nothing else." He proceeded to make another
and bigger, and, he hoped, a more satisfactory engine in
the following August; and with that object he removed
from the old cellar in King Street to a larger apartment in
the then disused pottery, or delftwork, near the Broomielaw.
There he shut himself up with his assistant, John Gardiner,
for the purpose of erecting his engine. The cylinder was
five or six inches in diameter, with a two-feet stroke.
The inner cylinder was enclosed in a wooden steam-case,
and placed inverted, the piston working through a hole
in the bottom of the steam-case. After two months continuous
application and labor it was finished and set to
work; but it leaked in all directions, and the piston was
far from air-tight. The condenser also was in a bad way,
and needed many alterations. Nevertheless, the engine
readily worked with ten and a half pounds pressure on
the inch, and the piston lifted a weight of fourteen
pounds. The improvement of the cylinder and piston
continued Watt's chief difficulty, and taxed his ingenuity
to the utmost. At so low an ebb was the art of making
cylinders that the one he used was not bored, but hammered,
the collective mechanical skill of Glasgow being
then unequal to the boring of a cylinder of the simplest
kind; nor, indeed, did the necessary appliances for the
purpose then exist anywhere else. In the Newcomen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
engine a little water was found upon the upper surface of
the piston, and sufficiently filled up the interstices between
the piston and the cylinder. But when Watt employed
steam to drive down the piston, he was deprived of this
resource, for the water and steam could not coexist.
Even if he had retained the agency of the air above, the
drip of water from the crevices into the lower part of the
cylinder would have been incompatible with keeping
the cylinder hot and dry, and, by turning into vapor as it
fell upon the heated metal, it would have impaired the
vacuum during the descent of the piston.</p>

<p>While he was occupied with this difficulty, and striving
to overcome it by the adoption of new expedients, such
as leather collars and improved workmanship, he wrote to
a friend, "My old white-iron man is dead;" the old white-iron
man, or tinner, being his leading mechanic. Unhappily,
also, just as he seemed to have got the engine into
working order, the beam broke, and, having great difficulty
in replacing the damaged part, the accident threatened,
together with the loss of his best workman, to bring the
experiment to an end. Though discouraged by these misadventures,
he was far from defeated. But he went on as
before, battling down difficulty inch by inch, and holding
good the ground he had won, becoming every day more
strongly convinced that he was in the right track, and that
the important uses of the invention, could he but find time
and means to perfect it, were beyond the reach of doubt.
But how to find the means! Watt himself was a comparatively
poor man; having no money but what he earned
by his business of mechanical-instrument making, which
he had for some time been neglecting through his devotion
to the construction of his engine. What he wanted
was capital, or the help of a capitalist willing to advance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
him the necessary funds to perfect his invention. To
give a fair trial to the new apparatus would involve an
expenditure of several thousand pounds; and who on the
spot could be expected to invest so large a sum in trying
a machine so entirely new, depending for its success on
physical principles very imperfectly understood?</p>

<p>There was no such help to be found in Glasgow. The
tobacco lords,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> though rich, took no interest in steam
power; and the manufacturing class, though growing in
importance, had full employment for their little capital
in their own concerns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"How Watt succeeded in interesting Dr. Roebuck in
his project, and thus obtained funds to continue his experiments;
how he finally joined with Matthew Boulton in the
great firm of Boulton and Watt, manufacturers of steam-engines;
how they pumped out all the water in the Cornish
mines; and how Watt finally attained prosperity as well
as success,&mdash;is an interesting story, but rather too long
for these winter afternoons; and as the story of the <i>invention</i>
of the steam-engine is substantially told in the
foregoing pages, we must stop our reading here, more
especially as it seems to be tea-time, and I hear Ellen
ringing the bell for supper."</p>

<p>They were to continue their talk and reading by
following along the developments in the use of
steam.</p>

<p>"Uncle Fritz," said Fanchon, "these agnostics make
so much fun of our dear Harry and Lucy, that they will
not let me quote from 'The Botanic Garden.'"</p>

<p>Emma promised that they would laugh as little as they
could.</p>

<p>"'The Botanic Garden,'" said Fanchon, "was a
stately, and I am afraid some of you would say very
pompous, poem, written by Dr. Darwin."</p>

<p>"Dr. Darwin write poetry!"</p>

<p>"It is not the Dr. Charles Darwin whom you have
heard of; it was his grandfather," said Uncle Fritz.</p>

<p>And Fanchon went on: "All I ever knew of 'The Botanic
Garden' was in the quotations of our dear Harry
and Lucy and Frank. But dear Uncle Fritz has taken
down the book for me, and here it is, with its funny old
pictures of Ladies' Slippers and such things."</p>

<p>"I do not see what Ladies' Slippers have to do with
steam-engines," said Bedford Long, scornfully.</p>

<p>"No!" said Fanchon, laughing; "but I do, and that
is the difference between you and me. Because, you see,
I have read 'Harry and Lucy,' and you have not." And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
she opened "The Botanic Garden" at the place where
she had put in a mark, and read:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Pressed by the ponderous air, the piston falls<br />
Resistless, sliding through its iron walls;<br />
Quick moves the balance beam of giant birth,<br />
Wields its large limbs, and nodding shakes the earth.<br />
The giant power, from earth's remotest caves<br />
Lifts, with strong arm, her dark reluctant waves,<br />
Each caverned rock and hidden depth explores,<br />
Drags her dark coals, and digs her shining ores."<br />
</p>

<p>"That is rather stilted poetry," said Uncle Fritz, "but a
hundred years ago people were used to stilted poetry. It
describes sufficiently well the original pumping-engine of
Watt, and the lifting of coal from the shafts of the deep
English mines. Now, it was not till Watt had made his
improvements on the pumping-engine,&mdash;say in 1788,&mdash;that
it was possible to go any farther in the use of steam
than its application to such absolutely stationary purposes.
It is therefore, I think, a good deal to the credit of Dr.
Darwin, that within three years after Watt's great improvement
in the condensing-engine the Doctor should have
written this:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
'Soon shall thy arm, unconquered steam, afar<br />
Drag the slow barge or drive the rapid car.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">It was twelve years after he wrote this, that Fulton had
an experimental steamboat on the river Seine in France.
It was sixteen years after, that, with one of Watt's own
engines, Fulton drove the 'Clermont' from New York to
Albany in thirty-six hours, and revolutionized the world in
doing it.</p>

<p>"Poor James Mackintosh was in virtual exile in Calcutta
at that time, and he wrote this in his journal: 'A boat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
propelled by steam has gone a hundred and fifty miles
upon the Hudson in thirty-six hours. Four miles an hour
would bring Calcutta within a hundred days of London.
Oh that we had lived a hundred years later!' In less
than fifty years after Mackintosh wrote those words, Calcutta
was within thirty days of London.</p>

<p>"When Harry and Lucy read these verses in 1825, the
'rapid car' was still in the future."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Fanchon; "but Harry says, 'The rapid
car is to come, and I dare say that will be accomplished
soon, papa; do not you think it will?'"</p>

<p>"I have sometimes wondered," said Uncle Fritz,
"whether our American word 'car' where the English say
'wagon' did not come from the 'rapid car' of Dr. Darwin.
Read on, Fanchon." And he put his finger on the lines
which Fanchon read:&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
"Or on wide waving wings, expanded, bear<br />
The flying chariot through the fields of air."<br />
</p>

<p>"Monsieur &mdash;&mdash;, the French gentleman, tried a light
steam-engine for the propulsion of a balloon in 1872; but
it does not seem to have had power enough. Messrs.
Renard and Krebs, in their successful flight of August last,
used an electric battery.</p>

<p>"But we are getting away from Fulton, who is really the
first who drove the 'slow barge,' and indeed made it a
very fast one."</p>

<p>"Did you know him?" asked Emma Fortinbras, whose
ideas of chronology are very vague.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Uncle Fritz; "he died young and before
my time. But I did know a personal companion and
friend, nay, a bedfellow of his, Benjamin Church, who was
with him in Paris at one of the crises of his life. Fulton had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
a little steamboat on the river Seine, as I said just now;
and he had made interest with Napoleon to have it examined
by a scientific committee. Steam power was exactly
what Napoleon wanted, to take his great army across from
Boulogne to England. The day came for the great experiment.
Church and Fulton slept, the night before, in the
same bed in their humble lodgings in Paris. At daybreak
a messenger waked them. He had come from the river
to say that the weight of boiler and machinery had been
too much for the little boat, that her timbers had given
way, and that the whole had sunk to the bottom of the
river. But for this misfortune, the successful steamboat
would have sailed upon the Seine, and, for aught I know,
Napoleon's grandchildren would now be emperors of
England."</p>

<p>Until Watt had completed the structure of the double-acting
condensing-engine, the application of steam to any
but the single object of pumping water had been almost
impracticable. It was not enough, in order to render it
applicable to general purposes, that the condensation of
the water should take place in a separate vessel, and that
steam itself should be used, instead of atmospheric pressure,
as the moving power; but it was also necessary that the
steam should act as well during the ascent as during the
descent of the piston. Before steam could be used in
moving paddle-wheels, it was in addition necessary that a
ready and convenient mode of making the motion of
the piston continuous and rotary, should be discovered.
All these improvements upon the original form of the
steam-engine are due to Watt, and he did not complete
their perfect combination before the year 1786.</p>

<p>Evans, who, in this country, saw the possibility of constructing
a double-acting engine, even before Watt, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
had made a model of his machine, did not succeed in
obtaining funds to make an experiment upon a large scale
before 1801. We conceive, therefore, that all those who
projected the application of steam to vessels before 1786,
may be excluded, without ceremony, from the list of those
entitled to compete with Fulton for the honors of invention.
No one, indeed, could have seen the powerful action
of a pumping-engine without being convinced that
the energy which was applied so successfully to that single
purpose, might be made applicable to many others; but
those who entertained a belief that the original atmospheric
engine, or even the single-acting engine of Watt,
could be applied to propel boats by paddle-wheels, showed
a total ignorance of mechanical principles. This is more
particularly the case with all those whose projects bore the
strongest resemblance to the plan which Fulton afterwards
carried successfully into effect. Those who approached
most nearly to the attainment of success, were they who
were farthest removed from the plan of Fulton. His application
was founded on the properties of Watt's double-acting
engine, and could not have been used at all, until
that instrument of universal application had received the
last finish of its inventor.</p>

<p>In this list of failures, from proposing to do what the
instrument they employed was incapable of performing, we
do not hesitate to include Savery, Papin, Jonathan Hulls,
P&eacute;rier, the Marquis de Jouffroy, and all the other names of
earlier date than 1786, whom the jealousy of the French
and English nations have drawn from oblivion for the
purpose of contesting the priority of Fulton's claims. The
only competitor, whom they might have brought forward
with some shadow of plausibility, is Watt himself. No
sooner had that illustrious inventor completed his double<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>-acting
engine, than he saw at a glance the vast field of its
application. Navigation and locomotion were not omitted;
but living in an inland town, and in a country possessing
no rivers of importance, his views were limited to canals
alone. In this direction he saw an immediate objection
to the use of any apparatus, of which so powerful an agent
as his engine should be the mover; for it was clear, that
the injury which would be done to the banks of the canal,
would prevent the possibility of its introduction. Watt,
therefore, after having conceived the idea of a steamboat,
laid it aside, as unlikely to be of any practical value.</p>

<p>The idea of applying steam to navigation was not confined
to Europe. Numerous Americans entertained hopes
of attaining the same object, but, before 1786, with the
same want of any reasonable hopes of success. Their
fruitless projects were, however, rebuked by Franklin,
who, reasoning upon the capabilities of the engine in its
original form, did not hesitate to declare all their schemes
impracticable; and the correctness of his judgment is at
present unquestionable.</p>

<p>Among those who, before the completion of Watt's invention,
attempted the structure of steamboats, must be
named with praise Fitch and Rumsey. They, unlike
those whose names have been cited, were well aware of the
real difficulties which they were to overcome; and both
were the authors of plans which, if the engine had been
incapable of further improvement, might have had a partial
and limited success. Fitch's trial was made in 1783,
and Rumsey's in 1787. The latter date is subsequent to
Watt's double-acting engine; but as the project consisted
merely in pumping in water, to be afterwards forced out at
the stern, the single-acting engine was probably employed.
Evans, whose engine might have answered the purpose,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
was employed in the daily business of millwright; and
although he might, at any time, have driven these competitors
from the field, he took no steps to apply his
dormant invention.</p>

<p>Fitch, who had watched the graceful and rapid way of
the Indian canoe, saw in the oscillating motion of the old
pumping-engine the means of impelling paddles in a manner
similar to that given them by the human arm. This
idea is extremely ingenious, and was applied in a simple
and beautiful manner. But the engine was yet too feeble
and cumbrous to yield an adequate force; and when it
received its great improvement from Watt, a more efficient
mode of propulsion had become practicable, and must
have superseded Fitch's paddles had they even come into
general use.</p>

<p>The experiments of Fitch and Rumsey in the United
States, although generally considered unsuccessful, did not
deter others from similar attempts. The great rivers and
arms of the sea which intersect the Atlantic coast, and,
still more, the innumerable navigable arms of the Father
of Waters, appeared to call upon the ingenious machinist
to contrive means for their more convenient navigation.</p>

<p>The improvement of the engine by Watt was now familiarly
known; and it was evident that it possessed sufficient
powers for the purpose. The only difficulty which existed,
was in the mode of applying it. The first person who
entered into the inquiry was John Stevens, of Hokoken,
who commenced his researches in 1791. In these he was
steadily engaged for nine years, when he became the associate
of Chancellor Livingston and Nicholas Roosevelt.
Among the persons employed by this association was
Brunel, who has since become distinguished in Europe as
the inventor of the block machinery used in the British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
navy-yards, and as the engineer of the tunnel beneath the
Thames.</p>

<p>Even with the aid of such talent, the efforts of this association
were unsuccessful,&mdash;as we now know, from no
error in principle, but from defects in the boat to which it
was applied. The appointment of Livingston as ambassador
to France broke up this joint effort; and, like all
previous schemes, it was considered abortive, and contributed
to throw discredit upon all undertakings of the
kind. A grant of exclusive privileges on the waters of the
State of New York was made to this association without
any difficulty, it being believed that the scheme was little
short of madness.</p>

<p>Livingston, on his arrival in France, found Fulton domiciliated
with Joel Barlow. The conformity in their pursuits
led to intimacy, and Fulton speedily communicated
to Livingston the scheme<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> which he had laid before Earl
Stanhope in 1793. Livingston was so well pleased with it
that he at once offered to provide the funds necessary for
an experiment, and to enter into a contract for Fulton's
aid in introducing the method into the United States, provided
the experiment were successful.</p>

<p>Fulton had, in his early discussion with Lord Stanhope,
repudiated the idea of an apparatus acting on the principle
of the foot of an aquatic bird, and had proposed
paddle-wheels in its stead. On resuming his inquiries after
his arrangements with Livingston, it occurred to him to
compose wheels with a set of paddles revolving upon an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
endless chain extending from the stem to the stern of the
boat. It is probable that the apparent want of success
which had attended the experiments of Symington<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> led
him to doubt the correctness of his original views.</p>

<p>That such doubt should be entirely removed, he had
recourse to a series of experiments upon a small scale.
These were performed at Plombi&egrave;res, a French watering-place,
where he spent the summer of 1802. In these experiments
the superiority of the paddle-wheel over every
other method of propulsion that had yet been proposed,
was fully established. His original impressions being thus
confirmed, he proceeded, late in the year 1803, to construct
a working model of his intended boat, which model
was deposited with a commission of French <i>savans</i>. He
at the same time began building a vessel sixty-six feet
in length and eight feet in width. To this an engine
was adapted; and the experiment made with it was so
satisfactory, as to leave little doubt of final success.</p>

<p>Measures were therefore immediately taken, preparatory
to constructing a steamboat on a larger scale in the
United States. For this purpose, as the workshops of
neither France nor America could at that time furnish an
engine of good quality, it became necessary to resort to
England for that purpose. Fulton had already experienced
the difficulty of being compelled to employ artists
unacquainted with the subject. It is, indeed, more than
probable, that, had he not, during his residence in Birmingham,
made himself familiar, not only with the general
features, but with the most minute details of the engine of
Watt, the experiment on the Seine could not have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
made. In this experiment, and in the previous investigations,
it became obvious that the engine of Watt required
important modifications in order to adapt it to navigation.
These modifications had been planned by Fulton; but it
now became important, that they should be more fully
tested. An engine was therefore ordered from Watt and
Boulton, without any specification of the object to which it
was to be applied; and its form was directed to be varied
from their usual models, in conformity to sketches furnished
by Fulton.</p>

<p>The order for an engine intended to propel a vessel of
large size, was transmitted to Watt and Boulton in 1803.
At about the same time, Chancellor Livingston, having
full confidence in the success of the enterprise, caused an
application to be made to the legislature of New York for
an exclusive privilege of navigating the waters of that
State by steam, that which was granted on a former occasion
having expired.</p>

<p>This privilege was granted with little opposition. Indeed,
those who might have been inclined to object, saw
so much of the impracticable and even of the ridiculous in
the project, that they conceived the application unworthy
of serious debate. The condition attached to the grant
was, that a vessel should be propelled by steam at the rate
of four miles an hour, within a prescribed space of time.
This reliance upon the reserved rights of the States proved
a fruitful source of vexation to Livingston and Fulton, and
imbittered the close of the life of the latter, and reduced
his family to penury. It can hardly be doubted that, had
an expectation been entertained, that the grant of a State
was ineffectual, and that the jurisdiction was vested in the
general government, a similar grant might have been obtained
from Congress. The influence of Livingston with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
the administration was deservedly high, and that administration
was supported by a powerful majority; nor would it
have been consistent with the principles of the opposition
to vote against any act of liberality to the introducer of
a valuable application of science. Livingston, however,
confiding in his skill as a lawyer, preferred the application
to the State, and was thus, by his own act, restricted to a
limited field.</p>

<p>Before the engine ordered from Watt and Boulton was
completed, Fulton visited England, and thus had an
opportunity of visiting Birmingham, and directing, in
person, its construction. It could only have been at
this time, if ever, that he saw the boat of Symington;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
but a view of it could have produced no effect upon his
own plans, which had been matured in France, and carried,
so far as the engine was concerned, to such an
extent as to admit of no alteration.</p>

<p>The engine was at last completed, and reached New
York in 1806. Fulton, who returned to his native country
about the same period, immediately undertook the
construction of a boat in which to place it. In ordering
his engine and in planning the boat, Fulton exhibited
plainly how far his scientific researches and practical
experiments had placed him before all his competitors.
He had evidently ascertained, what each successive year's
experience proves more fully, the great advantages possessed
by large steamboats over those of smaller size;
and thus, while all previous attempts had been made in
smaller vessels, he alone resolved to make his final experiment
in one of great dimensions. That a vessel,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
intended to be propelled by steam, ought to have very
different proportions, and lines of a character wholly
distinct from those of vessels intended to be navigated
by sails, was evident to him. No other theory, however,
of the resistance of fluids was admitted at the
time than that of Bossut, and there were no published
experiments except those of the British Society of Arts.
Judged in reference to these, the model chosen by Fulton
was faultless, although it will not stand the test of
an examination founded upon a better theory and more
accurate experiments.</p>

<p>The vessel was finished and fitted with her machinery
in August, 1807. An experimental excursion was forthwith
made, at which a number of gentlemen of science
and intelligence were present. Many of these were either
sceptical or absolute unbelievers. But a few minutes
served to convert the whole party, and satisfy the most
obstinate doubters, that the long-desired object was at
last accomplished. Only a few weeks before, the cost
of constructing and finishing the vessel threatening to
exceed the funds with which he had been provided by
Livingston, Fulton had attempted to obtain a supply
by the sale of one third of the exclusive right granted
by the State of New York. No person was found possessed
of the faith requisite to induce him to embark in
the project. Those who had rejected this opportunity
of investment, were now the witnesses of the completion
of the scheme, which they had considered as an
inadequate security for the desired funds.</p>

<p>Within a few days from the time of the first experiment
with the steamboat, a voyage was undertaken in it to
Albany. This city, situated at the natural head of the
navigation of the Hudson, is distant, by the line of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
channel of the river, rather less than one hundred and
fifty miles from New York. By the old post-road, the
distance is one hundred and sixty miles, at which that by
water is usually estimated. Although the greater part of
the channel of the Hudson is both deep and wide, yet
for about fourteen miles below Albany this character is
not preserved, and the stream, confined within comparatively
small limits, is obstructed by bars of sand or
spreads itself over shallows. In a few remarkable instances,
the sloops, which then exclusively navigated the
Hudson, had effected a passage in about sixteen hours;
but a whole week was not unfrequently employed in the
voyage, and the average time of passage was not less than
four entire days. In Fulton's first attempt to navigate this
stream, the passage to Albany was performed in thirty-two
hours, and the return in thirty.</p>

<p>Up to this time, although the exclusive grant had been
sought and obtained from the State of New York, it does
not appear that either he or his associate had been fully
aware of the vast opening which the navigation of the
Hudson presented for the use of steam. They looked to
the rapid Mississippi and its branches, as the place where
their triumph was to be achieved; and the original boat,
modelled for shallow waters, was announced as intended
for the navigation of that river. But even in the very
first attempt, numbers, called by business or pleasure to
the northern or western parts of the State of New York,
crowded into the yet untried vessel; and when the success
of the attempt was beyond question, no little anxiety was
manifested, that the steamboat should be established as a
regular packet between New York and Albany.</p>

<p>With these indications of public feeling Fulton immediately
complied, and regular voyages were made at stated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
times until the end of the season. These voyages were
not, however, unattended with inconvenience. The boat,
designed for a mere experiment, was incommodious; and
many of the minor arrangements by which facility of
working and safety from accident to the machinery were
to be insured, were yet wanting. Fulton continued a
close and attentive observer of the performance of the
vessel; every difficulty, as it manifested itself, was met and
removed by the most masterly as well as simple contrivances.
Some of these were at once adopted, while others
remained to be applied while the boat should be laid up
for the winter. He thus gradually formed in his mind the
idea of a complete and perfect vessel; and in his plan,
no one part which has since been found to be essential
to the ease of man&#339;uvre or security, was omitted. But
the eyes of the whole community were now fixed upon
the steamboat; and as all those of competent mechanical
knowledge were, like Fulton himself, alive to the defects
of the original vessel, his right to priority of invention of
various important accessories has been disputed.</p>

<p>The winter of 1807-8 was occupied in remodelling
and rebuilding the vessel, to which the name "Clermont"
was now given. The guards and housings for the wheels,
which had been but temporary structures, applied as their
value was pointed out by experience, became solid and
essential parts of the boat. For a rudder of the ordinary
form, one of surface much more extended in its horizontal
dimensions was substituted. This, instead of being moved
by a tiller, was acted upon by ropes applied to its extremity;
and these ropes were adapted to a steering-wheel,
which was raised aloft towards the bow of the vessel.</p>

<p>It had been shown by the numbers who were transported
during the first summer, that at the same price for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
passage, many were willing to undergo all the inconveniences
of the original rude accommodations, in preference
to encountering the delays and uncertainty to which the
passage in sloops was exposed. Fulton did not, however,
take advantage of his monopoly, but with the most liberal
spirit, provided such accommodations for passengers, as
in convenience and even splendor, had not before been
approached in vessels intended for the transportation of
travellers. This was, on his part, an exercise of almost
improvident liberality. By his contract with Chancellor
Livingston, the latter undertook to defray the whole cost
of the engine and vessel, until the experiment should
result in success; but from that hour each was to furnish
an equal share of all investments. Fulton had no patrimonial
fortune, and what little he had saved from the
product of his ingenuity was now exhausted. But the
success of the experiment had inspired the banks and
capitalists with confidence, and he now found no difficulty
in obtaining, in the way of loan, all that was needed.
Still, however, a debt was thus contracted which the continued
demands made upon him for new investments
never permitted him to discharge. The "Clermont,"
thus converted into a floating palace, gay with ornamental
painting, gilding, and polished woods, began her
course of passages for the second year in the month of
April.</p>

<p>The first voyage of this year was of the most discouraging
character. Chancellor Livingston, who had, by his
own experiments, approached as near to success as any
other person who, before Fulton, had endeavored to
navigate by steam, and who had furnished all the capital
necessary for the experiment, had plans and projects of
his own. These he urged into execution in spite of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
opposition of Fulton. The boiler furnished by Watt and
Boulton was not adapted to the object. Copied from
those used on the land, it required that its fireplace and
flues should be constructed of masonry. These added so
much weight to the apparatus, that the rebuilt boat would
hardly have floated had they been retained. In order to
replace this boiler, Livingston had planned a compound
structure of wood and copper, which he insisted should
be tried.</p>

<p>It is only necessary for us to say, that this boiler proved
a complete failure. Steam began to issue from its joints a
few hours after the "Clermont" left New York. It then
became impossible to keep up a proper degree of tension,
and the passage was thus prolonged to forty-eight hours.
These defects increased after leaving Albany on the return,
and the boiler finally gave way altogether within a few
miles of New York. The time of the downward passage
was thus extended to fifty-six hours. Fulton was, however,
thus relieved from all further interference; this fruitless
experiment was decisive as to his superiority over his
colleague in mechanical skill. He therefore immediately
planned and directed the execution of a new boiler, which
answered the purpose perfectly; and although there are
many reasons why boilers of a totally different form and
of subsequent invention should be preferred, it is, for its
many good properties, extensively used, with little alteration,
up to the present day. But a few weeks sufficed
to build and set this boiler, and in the month of June
the regular passages of the "Clermont" were renewed.</p>

<p>In observing the hour appointed for departure, both
from New York and Albany, Fulton determined to insist
upon the utmost regularity. It required no little perseverance
and resolution to carry this system of punctuality<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
into effect. Persons accustomed to be waited for by
packet-boats and stages, assented with great reluctance to
what they conceived to be a useless adherence to precision
of time. The benefits of this punctuality were speedily
perceptible; the whole system of internal communication
of the State of New York was soon regulated by the hours
of arrival and departure of Fulton's steamboats; and the
same system of precision was copied in all other steamboat
lines. The certainty of conveyance at stated times
being thus secured, the number of travellers was instantly
augmented; and before the end of the second summer,
the boat became far too small for the passengers, who
crowded to avail themselves of this novel, punctual, and
unprecedentedly rapid method of transport.</p>

<p>Such success, however, was not without its alloy. The
citizens of Albany and the river towns saw, as they thought,
in the steamboat, the means of enticing their customers
from their ancient marts to the more extensive market
of the chief city; the skippers of the river mourned the
inevitable loss of a valuable part of their business; and
innumerable projectors beheld with envy the successful
enterprise of Fulton.</p>

<p>Among the latter class was one who, misled by false
notions of mechanical principles, fancied that in the mere
oscillations of a pendulum lay a power sufficient for any
purpose whatever. Availing himself of a well-constructed
model, he exhibited to the inhabitants of Albany a pendulum
which continued its motions for a considerable time,
without requiring any new impulse, and at the same time
propelled a pair of wheels. These wheels, however, did
not work in water. Those persons who felt themselves
aggrieved by the introduction of steamboats, quickly embraced
this project, prompted by an enmity to Fulton,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
and determined, if they could not defeat his object, at
least to share in the profits of its success.</p>

<p>It soon appeared, from preliminary experiments, made
in a sloop purchased for the purpose, that a steam-engine
would be required to give motion to the pendulum; and
it was observed that the water-wheels, when in connection
with the pendulum, had a very irregular motion. A fly-wheel
was therefore added, and the pendulum was now
found to be a useless incumbrance. Enlightened by
these experiments, the association proceeded to build two
boats; and these were exact copies, not only of the hull
and all the accessories of the "Clermont," but the engine
turned out to be identical in form and structure with
one which Fulton was at the very time engaged in fitting
to his second boat, "The Car of Neptune."</p>

<p>The pretence of bringing into use a new description
of prime mover was of course necessarily abandoned, and
the owners of the new steamboats determined boldly to
test the constitutionality of the exclusive grant to Fulton.
Fulton and Livingston, in consequence, applied to the
Court of Chancery of the State of New York for an injunction,
which was refused. On an appeal to the Court
of Errors this decision of the Chancellor was reversed; but
the whole of the profits which might have been derived
from the business of the year were prevented from accruing
to Livingston and Fulton, who, compelled to contend
in price with an opposition supported by popular feeling
in Albany, were losers rather than gainers by the operations
of the season.</p>

<p>As no appeal was taken from this last decision, the
waters of the State of New York remained in the exclusive
possession of Fulton and his partner, until the death of
the former. This exclusive possession was not, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
attended with all the advantages that might have been
anticipated. The immense increase of travel which the
facilities of communication created, rendered it imperative
upon the holders of the monopoly to provide new facilities
by the construction of new vessels. The cost of these
could not be defrayed out of the profits. Hence new
and heavy debts were necessarily contracted by Fulton,
while Livingston, possessed of an ample fortune, required
no pecuniary aid beyond what he was able to meet from
his own resources.</p>

<p>The most formidable opposition which was made to the
privileges of Fulton, was founded upon the discoveries of
Fitch. We have seen, that he constructed a boat which
made some passages between Trenton and Philadelphia;
but the method which he used, was that of paddles,
which are far inferior to the paddle-wheel. Of the inferiority
of the method of paddles, had any doubt remained,
positive evidence was afforded in the progress of this dispute;
for in order to bring the question to the test of a
legal decision, a boat propelled by them was brought into
the waters of the State of New York. The result of the
experiment was so decisive, that when the parties engaged
in the enterprise had succeeded in their designs, they
made no attempt to propel their boats by any other
method than that of wheels.</p>

<p>Fulton, assailed in his exclusive privileges derived from
State grants, took, for his further protection, a patent from
the general government. This is dated in 1809, and was
followed by another, for improvements upon it, in 1811.
It now appeared, that the very circumstance in which the
greatest merit of his method consists, was to be the obstacle
to his maintaining an exclusive privilege. Discarding
all complexity, he had limited himself to the simple means<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
of adapting paddle-wheels to the crank of Watt's engine;
and, under the patent laws, it seems hardly possible that
such a simple yet effectual method could be guarded by
a specification. As has been the case with many other
important discoveries, the most ignorant conceived that
they might themselves have discovered it; and those unacquainted
with the history of the attempts at navigation
by steam, were compelled to wonder that it had been left
for Fulton to bring it into successful operation.</p>

<p>Before the death of Fulton, the steamboats on the
Hudson River were increased in number to five. A sixth
was built under his direction for the navigation of the
Sound; and, this water being rendered unsafe by the
presence of an enemy's<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> squadron, the boat plied for a
time upon the Hudson. In the construction of this boat
he had, in his own opinion, exhausted the power of steam
in navigation, having given it a speed of nine miles an
hour; and it is a remarkable fact, which manifests his
acquaintance with theory and skill in calculation, that he
in all cases predicted with almost absolute accuracy, the
velocity of the vessels he caused to be constructed. The
engineers of Great Britain came, long after, to a similar
conclusion in respect to the maximum of speed.</p>

<p>It is now, however, well known, that, with a proper construction
of prows, the resistance to vessels moving at
higher velocities than nine miles an hour, increases in
a much less ratio than had been inferred from experiments
made upon wedge-shaped bodies; and that the
velocity of the pistons of steam-engines may be conveniently
increased beyond the limit fixed by the practice
of Watt.</p>

<p>For these important discoveries the world is indebted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
principally to Robert L. Stevens. That Fulton must have
reached them in the course of his own practice can hardly
be doubted, had his valuable life been spared to watch
the performance of the vessels he was engaged in building
at the time of his premature death.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> These were, a
large boat intended for the navigation of the Hudson,
to which the name of his partner, Chancellor Livingston,
was given, and one planned for the navigation of the
ocean. The latter was constructed with the intention of
making a passage to St. Petersburg; but this scheme was
interrupted by his death, which took place at the moment
he was about to add to his glory, as the first constructor
of a successful steamboat, that of being the first navigator
of the ocean by this new and mighty agent.</p>

<p>"What I say is this," said Nahum, "that all your
Vesuvius dividends, and all your pickers and
slobbers, and shirtings at four cents, and all the rest of
your great cotton victory, depend on railroads. If your
father could not go to Lewiston and see his foreman and
people, and come back before you can say Jack Robinson,
there would be no mills at Lewiston such as there
are. There might be a poor little sawmill making shingles,
as you free-traders want." This with scorn at Fergus,
perhaps, or some one else suspected of views unfavorable
to protection.</p>

<p>Then Nahum shook hands with Uncle Fritz, and apologized
for his zeal, adding: "I am telling the boys why
I want to go to Altoona, and to become a railroad man. I
say that the new plant in India might knock cotton higher
than a kite, and that people might learn to live without
novels or magazines, but that they must have transportation
all the same. And I am going into the railroad
business. I am going to hew down the mountains and
fill up the valleys." The boy was fairly eloquent in his
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"It is in your blood, my brave fellow," said Uncle
Fritz. "People thought your grandfather was crazy when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
he said it, sixty years ago. But it proved he was the seer
and the prophet, and they were the fools."</p>

<p>"And who invented railroads?" asked Blanche.</p>

<p>"As to that, the man invented a railroad who first put
two boards down over two ruts to make a cart run easier.
Almost as soon as there were mines, there must have been
some sort of rail for the use of the wagons which brought
out the ore. These rails became so useful that they were
continued from the mine to the high-road, whatever it
was. But it was not till the first quarter of this century,
that rails were laid for general use. The earliest railroad
in the United States was laid at the quarries in Quincy,
in Massachusetts, in 1825."</p>

<p>Uncle Fritz was so well pleased at their eagerness that
he brought out for them some of the old books, and some
of the new. In especial he bade them all read Smiles's
"Life of Stephenson" before they came to him again.
For to George Stephenson, as they soon learned, more
than to any one man, the world owes the step forward
which it made when locomotives were generally used on
railroads. Since that time the improvements in both have
gone on together.</p>

<p>Before they met again, at Uncle Fritz's suggestion,
Fergus and Hester prepared this sketch of the details
of Stephenson's earlier invention, purposely that Uncle
Fritz might use it when these papers should be printed
together.</p>


<h3>GEORGE STEPHENSON.</h3>

<p>An efficient and economical working locomotive engine
still remained to be invented, and to accomplish this object
Stephenson now applied himself. Profiting by what
his predecessors had done,&mdash;warned by their failures and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
encouraged by their partial successes,&mdash;he began his
labors. There was still wanting the man who should accomplish
for the locomotive what James Watt had done
for the steam-engine, and combine in a complete form the
best points in the separate plans of others, embodying
with them such original inventions and adaptations of his
own, as to entitle him to the merit of inventing the working
locomotive, as James Watt is to be regarded as the
inventor of the working condensing-engine. This was the
great work upon which George Stephenson now entered,
though probably without any adequate idea of the ultimate
importance of his work to society and civilization.</p>

<p>He proceeded to bring the subject of constructing a
"Travelling Engine," as he denominated the locomotive,
under the notice of the lessees of the Killingworth Colliery,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
in the year 1813. Lord Ravensworth, the principal
partner, had already formed a very favorable opinion of the
new colliery engine-wright from the improvements which
he had effected in the colliery engines, both above and
below ground; and after considering the matter, and
hearing Stephenson's explanations, he authorized him to
proceed with the construction of a locomotive, though
his lordship was by some called a fool for advancing money
for such a purpose. "The first locomotive that I made,"
said Stephenson, many years after, when speaking of his
early career at a public meeting in Newcastle, "was at Kil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>lingworth
Colliery, and with Lord Ravensworth's money.
Yes, Lord Ravensworth and partners were the first to intrust
me, thirty-two years since, with money to make a
locomotive engine. I said to my friends, there was no
limit to the speed of such an engine, if the works could
be made to stand."</p>

<p>Our engine-wright had, however, many obstacles to
encounter before he could get fairly to work upon the
erection of his locomotive. His chief difficulty was in
finding workmen sufficiently skilled in mechanics and in
the use of tools to follow his instructions, and embody his
designs in a practical shape. The tools then in use about
the colliery were rude and clumsy, and there were no such
facilities, as now exist, for turning out machinery of any
entirely new character. Stephenson was under the necessity
of working with such men and tools as were at his
command, and he had in a great measure to train and
instruct the workmen himself. The new engine was built
in the workshops at the West Morr, the leading mechanic
being John Thirlwall, the colliery blacksmith,&mdash;an excellent
mechanic in his way, though quite new to the work
now intrusted to him.</p>

<p>In this first locomotive, constructed at Killingworth,
Stephenson to some extent followed the plan of Blenkinsop's
engine. The wrought-iron boiler was cylindrical,
eight feet in length and thirty-four inches in diameter,
with an internal flue-tube twenty inches wide passing
through it. The engine had two vertical cylinders, of
eight inches diameter and two feet stroke, let into the
boiler, which worked the propelling gear with cross-heads
and connecting-rods. The power of the two cylinders
was combined by means of spur-wheels, which communicated
the motive power to the wheels supporting the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
engine on the rail. The engine thus worked upon what is
termed the second motion. The chimney was of wrought-iron,
round which was a chamber extending back to the
feed-pumps, for the purpose of heating the water previous
to its injection into the boiler. The engine had no springs,
and was mounted on a wooden frame supported on four
wheels. In order to neutralize as much as possible the
jolts and shocks which such an engine would necessarily
encounter, from the obstacles and inequalities of the
then very imperfect plate-way, the water-barrel, which
served for a tender, was fixed to the end of a lever and
weighted; the other end of the lever being connected
with the frame of the locomotive carriage. By this means
the weight of the two was more equally distributed, though
the contrivance did not by any means compensate for the
total absence of springs.</p>

<p>The wheels of the locomotive were all smooth, Stephenson
having satisfied himself by experiment that the
adhesion between the wheels of a loaded engine and the
rail would be sufficient for the purposes of traction.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The engine was, after much labor and anxiety, and frequent
alterations of parts, at length brought to completion,
having been about ten months in hand. It was placed
upon the Killingworth Railway on the 25th of July, 1814,
and its powers were tried on the same day. On an ascending
gradient of 1 in 450, the engine succeeded in
drawing after it eight loaded carriages, of thirty tons weight,
at about four miles an hour; and for some time after it
continued regularly at work.</p>

<p>Although a considerable advance upon previous loco<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>motives,
"Blucher" (as the engine was popularly called)
was nevertheless a somewhat cumbrous and clumsy machine.
The parts were huddled together. The boiler
constituted the principal feature; and, being the foundation
of the other parts, it was made to do duty not only as
a generator of steam, but also as a basis for the fixings of
the machinery and for the bearings of the wheels and
axles. The want of springs was seriously felt; and the
progress of the engine was a succession of jolts, causing
considerable derangement to the working. The mode of
communicating the motive power to the wheels by means
of the spur-gear also caused frequent jerks, each cylinder
alternately propelling or becoming propelled by the other,
as the pressure of the one upon the wheels became greater
or less than the pressure of the other; and when the
teeth of the cog-wheels became at all worn, a rattling
noise was produced during the travelling of the engine.</p>

<p>As the principal test of the success of the locomotive
was its economy as compared with horse-power, careful
calculations were made with the view of ascertaining this
important point. The result was, that it was found the
working of the engine was at first barely economical; and
at the end of the year the steam-power and the horse-power
were ascertained to be as nearly as possible upon a
par in point of cost.</p>

<p>We give the remainder of the history of George Stephenson's
efforts to produce an economical working locomotive
in the words of his son Robert, as communicated
to Mr. Smiles in 1856, for the purposes of his father's
"Life."</p>

<p>"A few months of experience and careful observation
upon the operation of this (his first) engine convinced
my father that the complication arising out of the action<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
of the two cylinders being combined by spur-wheels would
prevent their coming into practical application. He then
directed his attention to an entire change in the construction
and mechanical arrangements, and in the following
year took out a patent, dated Feb. 28, 1815, for an
engine which combined in a remarkable degree the essential
requisites of an economical locomotive,&mdash;that is to
say, few parts, simplicity in their action, and great simplicity
in the mode by which power was communicated to
the wheels supporting the engine.</p>

<p>"This second engine consisted, as before, of two vertical
cylinders; which communicated directly with each pair of
the four wheels that supported the engine by a cross-head
and a pair of connecting-rods. But in attempting to
establish a direct communication between the cylinders
and the wheels that rolled upon the rails, considerable
difficulties presented themselves. The ordinary joints
could not be employed to unite the engine, which was a
rigid mass, with the wheels rolling upon the irregular surface
of the rails; for it was evident that the two rails of
the line of railway could not always be maintained at the
same level with respect to each other,&mdash;that one wheel at
the end of the axle might be depressed into a part of the
line which had subsided, while the other would be elevated.
In such a position of the axle and wheels it was clear that
a rigid communication between the cross-head and the
wheels was impracticable. Hence it became necessary
to form a joint at the top of the piston-rod where it united
with the cross-head, so as to permit the cross-head always
to preserve complete parallelism with the axle of the
wheels with which it was in communication.</p>

<p>"In order to obtain the flexibility combined with direct
action, which was essential for insuring power and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
avoiding needless friction and jars from irregularities in
the rail, my father employed the 'ball and socket joint'
for effecting a union between the ends of the cross-heads,
where they were united with the crank-pins attached to
each driving-wheel. By this arrangement the parallelism
between the cross-head and the axle was at all times maintained,
it being permitted to take place without producing
jar or friction upon any part of the machine.</p>

<p>"The next important point was to combine each pair
of wheels by some simple mechanism, instead of the cog-wheels
which had formerly been used. My father began
by inserting each axle into two cranks, at right angles to
each other, with rods communicating horizontally between
them. An engine was made upon this plan, and answered
extremely well. But at that period (1815) the mechanical
skill of the country was not equal to the task of forging
cranked axles of the soundness and strength necessary
to stand the jars incident to locomotive work; so my
father was compelled to fall back upon a substitute which,
though less simple and less efficient, was within the mechanical
capabilities of the workmen of that day, either
for construction or repair. He adopted a chain, which
rolled over indented wheels placed on the centre of each
axle, and so arranged that the two pairs of wheels were
effectually coupled and made to keep pace with each
other. But these chains after a few years' use became
stretched, and then the engines were liable to irregularity
in their working, especially in changing from working
back to forward again. Nevertheless, these engines continued
in profitable use upon the Killingworth Colliery
Railway for some years. Eventually the chain was laid
aside, and the wheels were united by rods on the <i>outside</i>
instead of rods and crank-axles inside, as specified in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
original patent; and this expedient completely answered
the purpose required, without involving any expensive or
difficult workmanship.</p>

<p>"Another important improvement was introduced in
this engine. The eduction steam had hitherto been
allowed to escape direct into the open atmosphere; but
my father having observed the great velocity with which
the smoke issued from the chimney of the same engine,
thought that by conveying the eduction steam into the
chimney, and there allowing it to escape in a vertical direction,
its velocity would be imparted to the smoke from
the engine, or to the ascending current of air in the chimney.
The experiment was no sooner made than the
power of the engine became more than doubled; combustion
was stimulated, as it were, by a blast; consequently,
the power of the boiler for generating steam was
increased, and in the same proportion, the useful duty of
the engine was augmented.</p>

<p>"Thus, in 1815 my father had succeeded in manufacturing
an engine which included the following important
improvements on all previous attempts in the same direction:
simple and direct communication between the
cylinder and the wheels rolling upon the rails; joint adhesion
of all the wheels, attained by the use of horizontal
connecting-rods; and, finally, a beautiful method of
exciting the combustion of fuel by employing the waste
steam which had formerly been allowed to escape uselessly.
It is perhaps not too much to say that this
engine, as a mechanical contrivance, contained the germ
of all that has since been effected. It may be regarded,
in fact, as a type of the present locomotive engine.</p>

<p>"In describing my father's application of the waste
steam for the purpose of increasing the intensity of com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>bustion
in the boiler, and thus increasing the power of the
engine without adding to its weight, and while claiming
for this engine the merit of being a type of all those which
have been successfully devised since the commencement
of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, it is necessary
to observe that the next great improvement in the same
direction, the 'multitubular boiler,' which took place
some years later, could never have been used without
the help of that simple expedient, <i>the steam-blast</i>, by
which power only, the burning of coke was rendered
possible.</p>

<p>"I cannot pass over this last-named invention of my
father's without remarking how slightly, as an original
idea, it has been appreciated; and yet how small would
be the comparative value of the locomotive engine of the
present day, without the application of that important
invention.</p>

<p>"Engines constructed by my father in the year 1818,
upon the principles just described, are in use on the Killingworth
Colliery Railway to this very day (1856), conveying,
at the speed of perhaps five or six miles an hour,
heavy coal-trains, probably as economically as any of the
more perfect engines now in use."</p>

<p>The invention of the steam-blast by George Stephenson
in 1815 was fraught with the most important consequences
to railway locomotion; and it is not saying too much
to aver that the success of the locomotive has been in a
great measure the result of its adoption. Without the
steam-blast, by means of which the intensity of combustion
is maintained at its highest point, producing a correspondingly
rapid evolution of steam, high rates of speed
could not have been kept up; the advantages of the multitubular
boiler (afterward invented) could never have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
been fully tested; and locomotives might still have been
dragging themselves unwieldily along at a rate of a little
more than five or six miles an hour.</p>

<p>As the period drew near for the opening of the line,
the question of the tractive power to be employed was
anxiously discussed. At the Brusselton decline, fixed
engines must necessarily be made use of; but with respect
to the mode of working the railway generally, it was
decided that horses were to be largely employed, and
arrangements were made for their purchase.</p>

<p>Although locomotives had been regularly employed in
hauling coal-wagons on the Middleton Colliery Railway,
near Leeds, for more than twelve years, and on the Wylam
and Killingworth Railways, near Newcastle, for more than
ten years, great scepticism still prevailed as to the economy
of employing them for the purpose in lieu of horses.
In this case, it would appear that seeing was <i>not</i> believing.
The popular scepticism was as great at Newcastle, where
the opportunities for accurate observation were the greatest,
as anywhere else. In 1824 the scheme of a canal between
that town and Carlisle again came up; and although a
few timid voices were raised on behalf of a railway, the
general opinion was still in favor of a canal. The example
of the Hetton Railway, which had been successfully
worked by Stephenson's locomotives for two years past,
was pointed to in proof of the practicability of a locomotive
line between the two places; but the voice of the
press, as well as of the public, was decidedly against the
"new-fangled roads."</p>

<p>When such was the state of public opinion as to railway
locomotion, some idea may be formed of the clear-sightedness
and moral courage of the Stockton and Darlington
directors in ordering three of Stephenson's locomotive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
engines, at a cost of several thousand pounds, against the
opening of the railway.</p>

<p>These were constructed after Stephenson's most matured
designs, and embodied all the improvements which
he had contrived up to that time. No. 1 engine, the
"Locomotion," which was first delivered, weighed about
eight tons. It had one large flue, or tube, through
the boiler, by which the heated air passed direct from
the furnace at the one end, lined with fire-bricks, to the
chimney at the other. The combustion in the furnace
was quickened by the adoption of the steam-blast in the
chimney. The heat raised was sometimes so great, and
it was so imperfectly abstracted by the surrounding water,
that the chimney became almost red-hot. Such engines,
when put to their speed, were found capable of running
at the rate of from twelve to sixteen miles an hour; but
they were better adapted for the heavy work of hauling
coal-trains at low speed&mdash;for which, indeed, they were
specially constructed&mdash;than for running at the higher
speed afterward adopted. Nor was it contemplated by the
directors as possible, at the time when they were ordered,
that locomotives could be made available for the purposes
of passenger travelling. Besides, the Stockton and Darlington
Railway did not run through a district in which
passengers were supposed to be likely to constitute any
considerable portion of the traffic.</p>

<p>We may easily imagine the anxiety felt by George Stephenson
during the progress of the works toward completion,
and his mingled hopes and doubts&mdash;though the
doubts were but few&mdash;as to the issue of this great experiment.
When the formation of the line near Stockton
was well advanced, the engineer one day, accompanied
by his son Robert and John Dixon, made a journey of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
inspection of the works. The party reached Stockton,
and proceeded to dine at one of the inns there. After
dinner, Stephenson ventured on the very unusual measure
of ordering in a bottle of wine, to drink success to the
railway. John Dixon relates with pride the utterance of
the master on the occasion "Now, lads," said he to
the two young men, "I venture to tell you that I think
you will live to see the day when railways will supersede
almost all other methods of conveyance in this country,&mdash;when
mail-coaches will go by railway, and railroads
will become the great highways for the king and all his
subjects. The time is coming when it will be cheaper for
a working man to travel on a railway than to walk on foot.
I know there are great and almost insurmountable difficulties
to be encountered, but what I have said will come
to pass as sure as you now hear me. I only wish I may
live to see the day, though that I can scarcely hope for,
as I know how slow all human progress is, and with what
difficulty I have been able to get the locomotive introduced
thus far, notwithstanding my more than ten years'
successful experiment at Killingworth." The result, however,
outstripped even George Stephenson's most sanguine
expectations; and his son Robert, shortly after his return
from America in 1827, saw his father's locomotive generally
adopted as the tractive power on mining-railways.</p>

<p>Tuesday, the 27th of September, 1825, was a great day
for Darlington. The railway, after having been under
construction for more than three years, was at length
about to be opened. The project had been the talk of
the neighborhood for so long that there were few people
within a range of twenty miles who did not feel more or
less interested about it. Was it to be a failure or a success?
Opinions were pretty equally divided as to the rail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>way;
but as regarded the locomotive, the general belief was
that it would "never answer." However, there was the
locomotive "No. 1" delivered upon the line, and ready
to draw the first train of wagons on the opening day.</p>

<p>A great concourse of people assembled on the occasion.
Some came from Newcastle and Durham, many
from the Aucklands, while Darlington held a general holiday
and turned out all its population. To give <i>&eacute;clat</i> to
the opening, the directors of the company issued a programme
of the proceedings, intimating the times at which
the procession of wagons would pass certain points along
the line. The proprietors assembled as early as six in the
morning at the Brusselton fixed engine, where the working
of the inclined planes was successfully rehearsed. A
train of wagons laden with coals and merchandise was
drawn up the western incline by the fixed engine, a length
of nineteen hundred and sixty yards in seven and a half
minutes, and then lowered down the incline on the eastern
side of the hill, eight hundred and eighty yards, in five
minutes.</p>

<p>At the foot of the incline the procession of vehicles was
formed, consisting of the locomotive engine No. 1, driven
by George Stephenson himself; after it, six wagons loaded
with coals and flour; then a covered coach containing
directors and proprietors; next, twenty-one coal-wagons
fitted up for passengers (with which they were crammed);
and lastly, six more wagons loaded with coals.</p>

<p>Strange to say, a man on a horse, carrying a flag with
the motto of the company inscribed on it, <i>Periculum privatum
utilitas publica</i>,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> headed the procession! A lithographic
view of the great event, published shortly after,
duly exhibits the horseman and his flag. It was not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>thought so dangerous a place, after all. The locomotive
was only supposed to be able to go at the rate of from
four to six miles an hour, and an ordinary horse could
easily keep ahead of that.</p>

<p>Off started the procession, with the horseman at its
head. A great concourse of people stood along the line.
Many of them tried to accompany it by running, and some
gentlemen on horseback galloped across the fields to
keep up with the train. The railway descending with a
gentle decline toward Darlington, the rate of speed was
consequently variable. At a favorable part of the road
Stephenson determined to try the speed of the engine,
and he called upon the horseman with the flag to get out
of his way! Most probably, deeming it unnecessary to
carry his <i>periculum privatum</i> farther, the horseman turned
aside, and Stephenson "put on the steam." The speed
was at once raised to twelve miles an hour, and, at a
favorable part of the road, to fifteen. The runners on foot,
the gentlemen on horseback, and the horseman with the
flag were consequently soon left far behind. When the
train reached Darlington, it was found that four hundred
and fifty passengers occupied the wagons, and that the
load of men, coals, and merchandise amounted to about
ninety tons.</p>

<p>At Darlington the procession was rearranged. The six
loaded coal-wagons were left behind, and other wagons
were taken on with a hundred and fifty more passengers,
together with a band of music. The train then started
for Stockton,&mdash;a distance of only twelve miles,&mdash;which
was reached in about three hours. The day was kept
throughout the district as a holiday; and horses, gigs,
carts, and other vehicles, filled with people, stood along
the railway, as well as crowds of persons on foot, waiting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
to see the train pass. The whole population of Stockton
turned out to receive the procession, and, after a walk
through the streets, the inevitable dinner in the Town
Hall wound up the day's proceedings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The principal circumstances connected with the construction
of the "Rocket," as described by Robert Stephenson
to Mr. Smiles, may be briefly stated. The
tubular principle was adopted in a more complete manner
than had yet been attempted. Twenty-five copper tubes,
each three inches in diameter, extended from one end of
the boiler to the other, the heated air passing through
them on its way to the chimney; and the tubes being
surrounded by the water of the boiler. It will be obvious
that a large extension of the heating surface was thus
effectually secured. The principal difficulty was in fitting
the copper tubes in the boiler ends so as to prevent leakage.
They were manufactured by a Newcastle copper-smith,
and soldered to brass screws which were screwed
into the boiler ends, standing out in great knobs. When
the tubes were thus fitted, and the boiler was filled with
water, hydraulic pressure was applied; but the water
squirted out at every joint, and the factory floor was soon
flooded. Robert went home in despair; and in the first
moment of grief he wrote to his father that the whole
thing was a failure. By return of post came a letter from
his father, telling him that despair was not to be thought
of,&mdash;that he must "try again;" and he suggested a
mode of overcoming the difficulty, which his son had already
anticipated and proceeded to adopt. It was to
bore clean holes in the boiler ends, fit in the smooth copper
tubes as tightly as possible, solder up, and then raise
the steam. This plan succeeded perfectly; the expansion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
of the copper completely filling up all interstices, and producing
a perfectly water-tight boiler, capable of standing
extreme external pressure.</p>

<p>The mode of employing the steam-blast for the purpose
of increasing the draught in the chimney, was also the
subject of numerous experiments. When the engine was
first tried, it was thought that the blast in the chimney
was not sufficiently strong for the purpose of keeping up
the intensity of the fire in the furnace, so as to produce
high-pressure steam with the required velocity. The expedient
was therefore adopted of hammering the copper
tubes at the point at which they entered the chimney,
whereby the blast was considerably sharpened; and on a
farther trial it was found that the draught was increased
to such an extent as to enable abundance of steam to be
raised. The rationale of the blast may be simply explained
by referring to the effect of contracting the pipe
of a water-hose, by which the force of the jet of water is
proportionately increased. Widen the nozzle of the pipe
and the jet is, in like manner, diminished. So is it with
the steam-blast in the chimney of the locomotive.</p>

<p>Doubts were, however, expressed whether the greater
draught obtained by the contraction of the blast-pipe were
not counterbalanced in some degree by the pressure upon
the piston. Hence a series of experiments was made
with pipes of different diameters, and their efficiency was
tested by the amount of vacuum that was produced in the
smoke-box. The degree of rarefaction was determined
by a glass tube fixed to the bottom of the smoke-box, and
descending into a bucket of water, the tube being open
at both ends. As the rarefaction took place, the water
would of course rise in the tube, and the height to which
it rose above the surface of the water in the bucket was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
made the measure of the amount of rarefaction. These
experiments proved that a considerable increase of draught
was obtained by the contraction of the orifice; accordingly,
the two blast-pipes opening from the cylinders into
either side of the "Rocket" chimney, and turned up
within it, were contracted slightly below the area of the
steam-ports; and before the engine left the factory, the
water rose in the glass tube three inches above the water
in the bucket.</p>

<p>The other arrangements of the "Rocket" were briefly
these: The boiler was cylindrical with flat ends, six feet in
length, and three feet four inches in diameter. The upper
half of the boiler was used as a reservoir for the steam,
the lower half being filled with water. Through the lower
part the copper tubes extended, being open to the fire-box
at one end, and to the chimney at the other. The
fire-box, or furnace, two feet wide and three feet high,
was attached immediately behind the boiler, and was also
surrounded with water. The cylinders of the engine were
placed on each side of the boiler, in an oblique position,
one end being nearly level with the top of the boiler at its
after end, and the other pointing toward the centre of the
foremost or driving pair of wheels, with which the connection
was directly made from the piston-rod to a pin on
the outside of the wheel. The engine, together with its
load of water, weighed only four tons and a quarter; and
it was supported on four wheels, not coupled. The tender
was four-wheeled, and similar in shape to a wagon,&mdash;the
foremost part holding the fuel, and the hind part a
water-cask.</p>

<p>When the "Rocket" was finished, it was placed upon
the Killingworth Railway for the purpose of experiment.
The new boiler arrangement was found perfectly success<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>ful.
The steam was raised rapidly and continuously, and
in a quantity which then appeared marvellous. The
same evening Robert despatched a letter to his father
at Liverpool, informing him to his great joy, that the
"Rocket" was "all right," and would be in complete
working trim by the day of trial. The engine was shortly
after sent by wagon to Carlisle, and thence shipped for
Liverpool.</p>

<p>The time so much longed for by George Stephenson
had now arrived, when the merits of the passenger locomotive
were about to be put to the test. He had fought
the battle for it until now, almost single-handed. Engrossed
by his daily labors and anxieties, and harassed
by difficulties and discouragements which would have
crushed the spirit of a less resolute man, he had held
firmly to his purpose through good and through evil report.
The hostility which he had experienced from some
of the directors opposed to the adoption of the locomotive,
was the circumstance that caused him the greatest grief of
all; for where he had looked for encouragement, he found
only carping and opposition. But his pluck never failed
him; and now the "Rocket" was upon the ground to
prove, to use his own words, "whether he was a man of
his word or not."</p>

<p>Great interest was felt at Liverpool, as well as throughout
the country, in the approaching competition. Engineers,
scientific men, and mechanics arrived from all
quarters to witness the novel display of mechanical ingenuity
on which such great results depended. The public
generally were no indifferent spectators, either. The populations
of Liverpool, Manchester, and the adjacent towns
felt that the successful issue of the experiment would
confer upon them individual benefits and local advantages<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
almost incalculable, while populations at a distance waited
for the result with almost equal interest.</p>

<p>On the day appointed for the great competition of locomotives
at Rainhill, the following engines were entered for
the prize:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Messrs. Braithwaite and Ericsson's "Novelty."</p>

<p>2. Mr. Timothy Hackworth's "Sanspareil."</p>

<p>3. Messrs. R. Stephenson &amp; Co.'s "Rocket."</p>

<p>4. Mr. Burstall's "Perseverance."</p>

<p>Another engine was entered by Mr. Brandreth, of Liverpool,&mdash;the
"Cycloped," weighing three tons, worked
by a horse in a frame,&mdash;but it could not be admitted to
the competition. The above were the only four exhibited,
out of a considerable number of engines constructed
in different parts of the country in anticipation of this
contest, many of which could not be satisfactorily completed
by the day of trial.</p>

<p>The day fixed for the competition was the 1st of October;
but to allow sufficient time to get the locomotives
into good working order, the directors extended it to the
6th. On the morning of the 6th the ground at Rainhill
presented a lively appearance, and there was as much
excitement as if the St. Leger were about to be run.
Many thousand spectators looked on, among whom were
some of the first engineers and mechanicians of the day.
A stand was provided for the ladies; the "beauty and
fashion" of the neighborhood were present, and the side
of the railroad was lined with carriages of all descriptions.</p>

<p>It was quite characteristic of the Stephensons that
although their engine did not stand first on the list for
trial, it was the first that was ready; and it was accordingly
ordered out by the judges for an experimental trip. Yet
the "Rocket" was by no means the "favorite" with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
either the judges or the spectators. Nicholas Wood has
since stated that the majority of the judges were strongly
predisposed in favor of the "Novelty," and that nine
tenths, if not ten tenths, of the persons present were against
the "Rocket" because of its appearance.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Nearly every
person favored some other engine, so that there was
nothing for the "Rocket" but the practical test. The
first trip made by it was quite successful. It ran about
twelve miles, without interruption, in about fifty-three
minutes.</p>

<p>The "Novelty" was next called out. It was a light
engine, very compact in appearance, carrying the water
and fuel upon the same wheels as the engine. The weight
of the whole was only three tons and one hundred-weight.
A peculiarity of this engine was that the air was driven or
forced through the fire by means of bellows. The day
being now far advanced, and some dispute having arisen
as to the method of assigning the proper load for the
"Novelty," no particular experiment was made farther than
that the engine traversed the line by way of exhibition,
occasionally moving at the rate of twenty-four miles an
hour. The "Sanspareil," constructed by Mr. Timothy
Hackworth, was next exhibited, but no particular experiment
was made with it on this day. This engine differed
but little in its construction from the locomotive last supplied
by the Stephensons to the Stockton and Darlington
Railway, of which Mr. Hackworth was the locomotive
foreman.</p>

<p>The contest was postponed until the following day; but
before the judges arrived on the ground, the bellows for
creating the blast in the "Novelty" gave way, and it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
found incapable of going through its performance. A
defect was also detected in the boiler of the "Sanspareil,"
and some farther time was allowed to get it repaired. The
large number of spectators who had assembled to witness
the contest were greatly disappointed at this postponement;
but to lessen it, Stephenson again brought out the
"Rocket," and attaching to it a coach containing thirty-four
persons, he ran them along the line at the rate of from
twenty-four to thirty miles an hour, much to their gratification
and amazement. Before separating, the judges ordered
the engine to be in readiness by eight o'clock on
the following morning, to go through its definitive trial
according to the prescribed conditions.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 8th of October the "Rocket"
was again ready for the contest. The engine was taken to
the extremity of the stage, the fire-box was filled with
coke, the fire lighted, and the steam raised until it lifted
the safety-valve loaded to a pressure of fifty pounds to the
square inch. This proceeding occupied fifty-seven minutes.
The engine then started on its journey, dragging
after it about thirteen tons weight in wagons, and made
the first ten trips backward and forward along the two
miles of road, running the thirty-five miles, including stoppages,
in an hour and forty-eight minutes. The second
ten trips were in like manner performed in two hours and
three minutes. The maximum velocity attained during
the trial trip was twenty-nine miles an hour, or about three
times the speed that one of the judges of the competition
had declared to be the limit of possibility. The average
speed at which the whole of the journeys were performed
was fifteen miles an hour, or five miles beyond the rate
specified in the conditions published by the company.
The entire performance excited the greatest astonishment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
among the assembled spectators; the directors felt confident
that their enterprise was now on the eve of success;
and George Stephenson rejoiced to think that, in spite of
all false prophets and fickle counsellors, the locomotive
system was now safe. When the "Rocket," having performed
all the conditions of the contest, arrived at the
"grand stand" at the close of its day's successful run, Mr.
Cropper&mdash;one of the directors favorable to the fixed-engine
system&mdash;lifted up his hands, and exclaimed, "Now
has George Stephenson at last delivered himself."</p>

<p>Neither the "Novelty" nor the "Sanspareil" was ready
for trial until the 10th, on the morning of which day an
advertisement appeared, stating that the former engine was
to be tried on that day, when it would perform more work
than any engine on the ground. The weight of the carriages
attached to it was only seven tons. The engine
passed the first post in good style; but in returning, the
pipe from the forcing-pump burst and put an end to the
trial. The pipe was afterward repaired, and the engine
made several trips by itself, in which it was said to have
gone at the rate of from twenty-four to twenty-eight miles
an hour.</p>

<p>The "Sanspareil" was not ready until the 13th; and
when its boiler and tender were filled with water, it was
found to weigh four hundred-weight beyond the weight
specified in the published conditions as the limit of four-wheeled
engines; nevertheless, the judges allowed it to run
on the same footing as the other engines, to enable them
to ascertain whether its merits entitled it to favorable consideration.
It travelled at the average speed of about
fourteen miles an hour with its load attached; but at the
eighth trip the cold-water pump got wrong, and the engine
could proceed no farther.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>It was determined to award the premium to the successful
engine on the following day, the 14th, on which
occasion there was an unusual assemblage of spectators.
The owners of the "Novelty" pleaded for another trial,
and it was conceded. But again it broke down. Then
Mr. Hackworth requested the opportunity for making
another trial of his "Sanspareil." But the judges had now
had enough of failures, and they declined, on the ground
that not only was the engine above the stipulated weight,
but that it was constructed on a plan which they could not
recommend for adoption by the directors of the company.
One of the principal practical objections to this locomotive
was the enormous quantity of coke consumed or wasted
by it,&mdash;about six hundred and ninety-two pounds per
hour when travelling,&mdash;caused by the sharpness of the
steam-blast in the chimney, which blew a large proportion
of the burning coke into the air.</p>

<p>The "Perseverance" of Mr. Burstall was found unable
to move at more than five or six miles an hour, and it was
withdrawn from the contest at an early period. The
"Rocket" was thus the only engine that had performed,
and more than performed, all the stipulated conditions;
and it was declared to be entitled to the prize of &pound;500,
which was awarded to the Messrs. Stephenson and Booth<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
accordingly. And farther to show that the engine had
been working quite within its powers, George Stephenson
ordered it to be brought upon the ground and detached
from all incumbrances, when, in making two trips, it was
found to travel at the astonishing rate of thirty-five miles
an hour.</p>

<p>The "Rocket" had thus eclipsed the performances of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
all locomotive engines that had yet been constructed, and
outstripped even the sanguine expectations of its constructors.
It satisfactorily answered the report of Messrs.
Walker and Rastrick, and established the efficiency of the
locomotive for working the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway, and indeed all future railways. The "Rocket"
showed that a new power had been born into the world,
full of activity and strength, with boundless capability of
work. It was the simple but admirable contrivance of the
steam-blast, and its combination with the multitubular
boiler, that at once gave locomotion a vigorous life, and
secured the triumph of the railway system. As has been
well observed, this wonderful ability to increase and multiply
its powers of performance with the emergency that
demands them, has made this giant engine the noblest
creation of human wit, the very lion among machines.</p>

<p>The success of the Rainhill experiment, as judged by
the public, may be inferred from the fact that the shares of
the company immediately rose ten per cent, and nothing
farther was heard of the proposed twenty-one fixed engines,
engine-houses, ropes, etc. All this cumbersome
apparatus was thenceforth effectually disposed of.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the reading was over, Bedford said: "When I
heard you were going to have George Stephenson this
afternoon, I wrote to my cousin Prentiss Armstrong, who
has been at the locomotive works at Altoona for several
years, and asked him about locomotives nowadays, that I
might be able to compare them with the locomotives of
George Stephenson's time. This is his letter, which I'll
read, if there be no objection:"&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Bedford</span>,&mdash;Speaking roughly, a freight-engine
of the "Consolidation" type (eight driving-wheels and two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
truck-wheels) weighs from forty-seven to forty-eight tons
of two thousand pounds. On a road with no grades over
twenty feet to the mile (1 in 250) it will haul over one
thousand tons at fifteen miles an hour. If the train is of
merchandise, it will be of say fifty cars, each weighing ten
tons and carrying ten tons. If it is of coal or ore, the
cars will each carry twenty or twenty-five tons.</p>

<p>["The 'Rocket,'" said Bedford, "which was the successful
engine at the Rainhill competition, weighed a little
over four tons and had four wheels. Dragging a weight of
thirteen tons in wagons, it made thirty-five miles in about
two hours."]</p>

<p>Our Engine No. 2 [continued the letter] made a mile
on a level in forty-three seconds with no train, but there
are very few such records. Two of our fast trains (four
cars each, weighing twenty-five tons) make a schedule
in one place (level) of nine miles in eight minutes. I
have seen a record of a run on the Bound Brook route
of four cars, ten miles in eight minutes. I think this must
have been down hill.</p>

<p>I hope these facts will answer your views. If there's
anything else that I can get up for you, I shall be glad to
do it.</p>

<p class="center">Yours truly,</p>

<p>The young people all came in laughing.</p>

<p>"And what is it?" said Uncle Fritz, good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"It is this," said Alice, "that I say that all this is very

and I have been boasting that I know as much of the

I do not see that this is going to profit Blanche when she

<p>"Is it certain that Blanche is to go?" said Uncle Fritz,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, Uncle Fritz, do you know?" said Blanche, in
mock heroics; "are you in the sacred circle which decides?
Will the Vesuvius pass its dividend, or will it scatter its
blessings right and left, so that we can go to Paris and all

<p>"I wish I knew," said Colonel Ingham; "for on that
same dividend depends the question whether I build four
new rooms at Little Crastis for the accommodation of my
young friends when they visit me there."</p>

<p>"Could you tell us," said Fergus, "what is the cause of
the depression in the cotton-manufacture?"</p>

<p>"Don't tell him, Uncle Fritz," said Fanchon, "for the
two best of reasons,&mdash;first, that half of us will not un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>derstand
if you do; and second, that none of us will
remember."</p>

<p>Colonel Ingham laughed. "And third," he said, "that
we are to talk about Inventions and Inventors, and we
shall not get to Fergus's grand question till we come to the
series on 'Political Economy and Political Economists.'</p>

<p>"You are all quite right in all your suggestions and
criticisms. It is quite time that you girls should know
something of the industry which is important not only to
all the Southern States, but to all the manufacturing States.
Cotton is the cheapest article for clothing in the world, and
the use of it goes farther and farther every year. The
manufacture is also improving steadily. Thirty men,
women, and children will make as much cotton cloth
to-day as a hundred could make the year you were born,
Hester. I saw cottons for sale to-day at four cents a yard
which would have cost nearly three times that money
thirty years ago. So I have laid out for you these sketches
of the life of Eli Whitney, on whose simple invention, as
you remember, all this wealth of production may be said
to depend. You college boys ought to be pleased to
know, that within a year after this man graduated from
Yale College, he had made an invention and set it a going,
which entirely changed the face of things in his own
country. At that moment there was so little cotton raised
in America, that Whitney himself had never seen cotton
wool or cotton seed, when he was first asked if he could
make a machine which would separate one from the other.
It was so little known, indeed, that when John Jay of New
York negotiated a treaty of commerce with England in
1794, the year after Whitney's invention, he did not know
that any cotton was produced in the United States. The
treaty did not provide for our cotton, and had to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
changed after it was brought back to America. With this
invention by Whitney, it was possible to clean cotton from
the seed. The Southern States, which before had no
staple of importance, had in that moment an immense addition
to their resources. Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,
and Tennessee, besides the States in the old thirteen, were
settled almost wholly to call into being new lands for
raising cotton. To these were afterwards added Arkansas,
Florida, and Texas. With this new industry slave
labor became vastly more profitable; and the institution
of slavery, which would else have died out probably, received
an immense stimulus. Fortunately for the country
and the world, the Constitution had fixed the year 1808,
as the end of the African slave trade. But, up to that
date, slaves were pushed in with a constantly increasing
rapidity, so that the new States were peopled very largely
with absolute barbarians. There is hardly another instance
in history where it is so easy to trace in a very few
years, results so tremendous following from a single invention
by a single man.</p>

<p>"Fortunately for us, Miss Lamb has just published a
portrait of Eli Whitney in the 'Magazine of History.'
Here it is, in the October number of the 'Magazine of
History.'</p>

<p>"As to processes of manufacture, of course we can
learn little or nothing about them here. But you had
better read carefully this article in Ure's 'Dictionary of
Arts,' though it is a little old-fashioned, and then you will
be prepared to make up parties to go out to the Hecla, or
up to Lowell or Lawrence, where you can see with your
own eyes.</p>

<p>"And now I will read you a little sketch of the life of
Eli Whitney."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<h3>ELI WHITNEY.</h3>

<p>Eli Whitney was born at Westborough, Worcester
County, Massachusetts, Dec. 8, 1765. His parents belonged
to the middle class in society, who, by the labors
of husbandry, managed by uniform industry and strict frugality
to provide well for a rising family.</p>

<p>The paternal ancestors of Mr. Whitney emigrated from
England among the early settlers of Massachusetts, and
their descendants were among the most respectable farmers
of Worcester County. His maternal ancestors, of the
name of Fay, were also English emigrants, and ranked
among the substantial yeomanry of Massachusetts. A
family tradition respecting the occasion of their coming
to this country may serve to illustrate the history
of the times. The story is, that about two hundred years
ago, the father of the family, who resided in England, a
man of large property and great respectability, called together
his sons and addressed them thus: "America is
to be a great country. I am too old to emigrate myself;
but if any one of you will go, I will give him a double
share of my property." The youngest son instantly declared
his willingness to go, and his brothers gave their
consent. He soon set off for the New World, and landed
in Boston, in the neighborhood of which place he purchased
a large tract of land, where he enjoyed the satisfaction
of receiving two visits from his venerable father. His
son John Fay, from whom the subject of this memoir is
immediately descended, removed from Boston to Westborough,
where he became the proprietor of a large tract
of land, since known by the name of the Fay Farm.</p>

<p>From the sister of Mr. Whitney, we have derived some
particulars respecting his childhood and youth, and we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
shall present the anecdotes to our readers in the artless
style in which they are related by our correspondent, believing
that they would be more acceptable in this simple
dress than if, according to the modest suggestion of the
writer, they should be invested with a more labored diction.
The following incident, though trivial in itself, will
serve to show at how early a period certain qualities of
strong feeling tempered by prudence, for which Mr. Whitney
afterward became distinguished, began to display themselves.
When he was six or seven years old he had
overheard the kitchen maid, in a fit of passion, calling his
mother, who was in a delicate state of health, hard names,
at which he expressed great displeasure to his sister.
"She thought," said he, "that I was not big enough to
hear her talk so about my mother. I think she ought to
have a flogging; and if I knew how to bring it about, she
should have one." His sister advised him to tell their
father. "No," he replied, "it will hurt his feelings and
mother's too; and besides, it is likely the girl will say she
never said so, and that would make a quarrel. It is best
to say nothing about it."</p>

<p>Indications of his mechanical genius were likewise developed
at a very early age. Of his early passion for
such employments, his sister gives the following account:
"Our father had a workshop, and sometimes made wheels
of different kinds, and chairs. He had a variety of tools,
and a lathe for turning chair-posts. This gave my brother
an opportunity of learning the use of tools when very
young. He lost no time; but as soon as he could handle
tools, he was always making something in the shop, and
seemed not to like working on the farm. On a time, after
the death of our mother, when our father had been absent
from home two or three days, on his return he inquired of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the housekeeper what the boys had been doing. She told
him what B. and J. had been about. 'But what has Eli
been doing?' said he. She replied he had been making
a fiddle. 'Ah,' said he, despondingly, 'I fear Eli will
have to take his portion in fiddles.' He was at this time
about twelve years old. His sister adds that this fiddle
was finished throughout, like a common violin, and made
tolerably good music. It was examined by many persons,
and all pronounced it to be a remarkable piece of work
for such a boy to perform. From this time he was employed
to repair violins, and had many nice jobs, which
were always executed to the entire satisfaction, and often
to the astonishment, of his customers. His father's watch
being the greatest piece of mechanism that had yet presented
itself to his observation, he was extremely desirous
of examining its interior construction, but was not permitted
to do so. One Sunday morning, observing that his
father was going to meeting, and would leave at home the
wonderful little machine, he immediately feigned illness as
an apology for not going to church. As soon as the family
were out of sight, he flew to the room where the watch
hung, and taking it down he was so delighted with its
motions that he took it all to pieces before he thought of
the consequences of his rash deed; for his father was a
stern parent, and punishment would have been the reward
of his idle curiosity, had the mischief been detected. He,
however, put all the work so neatly together that his father
never discovered his audacity until he himself told him,
many years afterwards.</p>

<p>"Whitney lost his mother at an early age, and when he
was thirteen years old his father married a second time.
His stepmother, among her articles of furniture, had a
handsome set of table knives that she valued very highly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
Whitney could not but see this, and said to her, 'I could
make as good ones if I had tools, and I could make the necessary
tools if I had a few common tools to make them
with.' His stepmother thought he was deriding her, and was
much displeased; but it so happened, not long afterwards,
that one of the knives got broken, and he made one exactly
like it in every respect except the stamp on the blade.
This he would likewise have executed, had not the tools
required been too expensive for his slender resources."</p>

<p>When Whitney was fifteen or sixteen years of age he
suggested to his father an enterprise, which was an earnest
of the similar undertakings in which he engaged on a far
greater scale in later life. This being the time of the
Revolutionary War, nails were in great demand and bore
a high price. At that period nails were made chiefly by
hand, with little aid from machinery. Young Whitney
proposed to his father to procure him a few tools, and to
permit him to set up the manufacture. His father consented;
and he went steadily to work, and suffered nothing
to divert him from his task until his day's work was completed.
By extraordinary diligence he gained time to
make tools for his own use, and to put in knife-blades, and
to perform many other curious little jobs which exceeded
the skill of the country artisans. At this laborious occupation
the enterprising boy wrought alone, with great success,
and with much profit to his father, for two winters, pursuing
the ordinary labors of the farm during the summers.
At this time he devised a plan for enlarging his business
and increasing his profits. He whispered his scheme to
his sister, with strong injunctions of secrecy; and requesting
leave of his father to go to a neighboring town, without
specifying his object, he set out on horseback in quest of
a fellow-laborer. Not finding one as easily as he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
anticipated, he proceeded from town to town with a perseverance
which was always a strong trait of his character,
until, at a distance of forty miles from home, he found
such a workman as he desired. He also made his journey
subservient to his mechanical skill, for he called at every
workshop on his way and gleaned all the information he
could respecting the mechanical arts.</p>

<p>At the close of the war the business of making nails was
no longer profitable; but a fashion prevailing among the
ladies of fastening on their bonnets with long pins, he
contrived to make those with such skill and dexterity that
he nearly monopolized the business, although he devoted
to it only such seasons of leisure as he could redeem from
the occupations of the farm, to which he now principally
betook himself. He added to this article, the manufacture
of walking-canes, which he made with peculiar neatness.</p>

<p>In respect to his proficiency in learning while young, we
are informed that he early manifested a fondness for figures
and an uncommon aptitude for arithmetical calculations,
though in the other rudiments of education he was
not particularly distinguished. Yet at the age of fourteen
he had acquired so much general information, as to be
regarded on this account, as well as on account of his
mechanical skill, a very remarkable boy.</p>

<p>From the age of nineteen, young Whitney conceived
the idea of obtaining a liberal education; but, being warmly
opposed by his stepmother, he was unable to procure the
decided consent of his father, until he had reached the age
of twenty-three years. But, partly by the avails of his
manual labor and partly by teaching a village school, he
had been so far able to surmount the obstacles thrown in
his way, that he had prepared himself for the Freshman
Class in Yale College, which he entered in May, 1789.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>The propensity of Mr. Whitney to mechanical inventions
and occupations, was frequently apparent during his
residence at college. On a particular occasion, one of the
tutors, happening to mention some interesting philosophical
experiment, regretted that he could not exhibit it to
his pupils, because the apparatus was out of order and
must be sent abroad to be repaired. Mr. Whitney proposed
to undertake this task, and performed it greatly to
the satisfaction of the faculty of the college.</p>

<p>A carpenter being at work upon one of the buildings of
the gentleman with whom Mr. Whitney boarded, the latter
begged permission to use his tools, during the intervals of
study; but the mechanic, being a man of careful habits,
was unwilling to trust them with a student, and it was only
after the gentleman of the house had become responsible
for all damages, that he would grant the permission. But
Mr. Whitney had no sooner commenced his operations
than the carpenter was surprised at his dexterity, and exclaimed,
"There was one good mechanic spoiled when
you went to college."</p>

<p>Soon after Mr. Whitney took his degree, in the autumn
of 1792, he entered into an engagement with a Mr. B. of
Georgia, to reside in his family as a private teacher. On
his way thither, he was so fortunate as to have the company
of Mrs. Greene, the widow of General Greene, who, with
her family, was returning to Savannah after spending the
summer at the North. At that time it was deemed unsafe
to travel through our country without having had the
small-pox, and accordingly Mr. Whitney prepared himself for
the excursion, by procuring inoculation while in New York.
As soon as he was sufficiently recovered, the party set sail
for Savannah. As his health was not fully re-established,
Mrs. Greene kindly invited him to go with the family to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
her residence at Mulberry Grove, near Savannah, and
remain until he was recruited. The invitation was accepted;
but lest he should not yet have lost all power of
communicating that dreadful disease, Mrs. Greene had
white flags (the meaning of which was well understood)
hoisted at the landing and at all the avenues leading to
the house. As a requital for her hospitality, her guest
procured the virus and inoculated all the servants of the
household, more than fifty in number, and carried them
safely through the disorder.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitney had scarcely set his foot in Georgia, before
he was met by a disappointment which was an earnest of
that long series of adverse events which, with scarcely an
exception, attended all his future negotiations in the same
State. On his arrival he was informed that Mr. B. had
employed another teacher, leaving Whitney entirely without
resources or friends, except those whom he had made in
the family of General Greene. In these benevolent people,
however, his case excited much interest; and Mrs. Greene
kindly said to him, "My young friend, you propose studying
the law; make my house your home, your room
your castle, and there pursue what studies you please."
He accordingly began the study of the law under that
hospitable roof.</p>

<p>Mrs. Greene was engaged in a piece of embroidery in
which she employed a peculiar kind of frame, called a
<i>tambour</i>. She complained that it was badly constructed,
and that it tore the delicate threads of her work. Mr.
Whitney, eager for an opportunity to oblige his hostess, set
himself to work and speedily produced a tambour-frame,
made on a plan entirely new, which he presented to her.
Mrs. Greene and her family were greatly delighted with it,
and thought it a wonderful proof of ingenuity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>Not long afterwards a large party of gentlemen, consisting
principally of officers who had served under the General
in the Revolutionary Army, came from Augusta and
the upper country, to visit the family of General Greene.
They fell into conversation upon the state of agriculture
among them, and expressed great regret that there was no
means of cleansing the green seed cotton, or separating it
from its seed, since all the lands which were unsuitable for
the cultivation of rice, would yield large crops of cotton.
But until ingenuity could devise some machine which
would greatly facilitate the process of cleaning, it was vain
to think of raising cotton for market. Separating one
pound of the clean staple from the seed was a day's work
for a woman; but the time usually devoted to picking
cotton was the evening, after the labor of the field was
over. Then the slaves&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;were
collected in circles, with one whose duty it was to rouse
the dozing and quicken the indolent. While the company
were engaged in this conversation, "Gentlemen," said
Mrs. Greene, "apply to my young friend Mr. Whitney;
he can make anything." Upon which she conducted
them into a neighboring room, and showed them her tambour-frame
and a number of toys which Mr. Whitney had
made or repaired for the children. She then introduced
the gentlemen to Whitney himself, extolling his genius
and commending him to their notice and friendship. He
modestly disclaimed all pretensions to mechanical genius;
and when they named their object, he replied that he had
never seen either cotton or cotton seed in his life. Mrs.
Greene said to one of the gentlemen, "I have accomplished
my aim. Mr. Whitney is a very deserving young
man, and to bring him into notice was my object. The
interest which our friends now feel for him will, I hope,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
lead to his getting some employment to enable him to
prosecute the study of the law."</p>

<p>But a new turn, that no one of the company dreamed of,
had been given to Mr. Whitney's views. It being out of
season for cotton in the seed, he went to Savannah and
searched among the warehouses and boats until he found
a small parcel of it. This he carried home, and communicated
his intentions to Mr. Miller, who warmly encouraged
him, and assigned him a room in the basement of the house,
where he set himself to work with such rude materials and
instruments as a Georgia plantation afforded. With these
resources, however, he made tools better suited to his purpose,
and drew his own wire (of which the teeth of the
earliest gins were made),&mdash;an article which was not at that
time to be found in the market of Savannah. Mrs. Greene
and Mr. Miller were the only persons ever admitted to his
workshop, and the only persons who knew in what way he
was employing himself. The many hours he spent in his
mysterious pursuits, afforded matter of great curiosity and
often of raillery to the younger members of the family.
Near the close of the winter, the machine was so nearly
completed as to leave no doubt of its success.</p>

<p>Mrs. Greene was eager to communicate to her numerous
friends the knowledge of this important invention, peculiarly
important at that time, because then the market was
glutted with all those articles which were suited to the climate
and soil of Georgia, and nothing could be found to
give occupation to the negroes and support to the white
inhabitants. This opened suddenly to the planters boundless
resources of wealth, and rendered the occupations of
the slaves less unhealthy and laborious than they had been
before.</p>

<p>Mrs. Greene, therefore, invited to her house gentlemen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
from different parts of the State; and on the first day after
they had assembled, she conducted them to a temporary
building which had been erected for the machine, and
they saw with astonishment and delight, that more cotton
could be separated from the seed in one day, by the labor
of a single hand, than could be done in the usual manner
in the space of many months.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitney might now have indulged in bright reveries
of fortune and of fame; but we shall have various opportunities
of seeing that he tempered his inventive genius
with an unusual share of the calm, considerate qualities of
the financier. Although urged by his friends to secure a
patent and devote himself to the manufacture and introduction
of his machines, he coolly replied that, on account
of the great expenses and trouble which always attend the
introduction of a new invention, and the difficulty of
enforcing a law in favor of patentees, in opposition to
the individual interests of so large a number of persons as
would be concerned in the culture of this article, it was
with great reluctance that he should consent to relinquish
the hopes of a lucrative profession, for which he had been
destined, with an expectation of indemnity either from the
justice or the gratitude of his countrymen, even should
the invention answer the most sanguine anticipations of
his friends.</p>

<p>The individual who contributed most to incite him to
persevere in the undertaking, was Phineas Miller. Mr.
Miller was a native of Connecticut and a graduate of Yale
College. Like Mr. Whitney, soon after he had completed
his education at college, he came to Georgia as a private
teacher in the family of General Greene, and after the decease
of the General, he became the husband of Mrs.
Greene. He had qualified himself for the profession of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
the law, and was a gentleman of cultivated mind and
superior talents; but he was of an ardent temperament,
and therefore well fitted to enter with zeal into the views
which the genius of his friend had laid open to him. He
also had considerable funds at command, and proposed
to Mr. Whitney to become his joint adventurer, and to
be at the whole expense of maturing the invention until it
should be patented. If the machine should succeed in its
intended operation, the parties agreed, under legal formalities,
"that the profits and advantages arising therefrom, as
well as all privileges and emoluments to be derived from
patenting, making, vending, and working the same, should
be mutually and equally shared between them." This
instrument bears date May 27, 1793; and immediately
afterward they commenced business under the firm of
Miller and Whitney.</p>

<p>An invention so important to the agricultural interest
(and, as it has proved, to every department of human
industry) could not long remain a secret. The knowledge
of it soon spread through the State, and so great was
the excitement on the subject, that multitudes of persons
came from all quarters of the State to see the machine;
but it was not deemed safe to gratify their curiosity until
the patent right had been secured. But so determined
were some of the populace to possess this treasure, that
neither law nor justice could restrain them; they broke
open the building by night, and carried off the machine.
In this way the public became possessed of the invention;
and before Mr. Whitney could complete his model and
secure his patent, a number of machines were in successful
operation, constructed with some slight deviation from
the original, with the hope of escaping the penalty for
evading the patent right.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as the copartnership of Miller and Whitney was
formed, Mr. Whitney repaired to Connecticut, where,
as far as possible, he was to perfect the machine, obtain
a patent, and manufacture and ship to Georgia such a
number of machines as would supply the demand.</p>

<p>Within three days after the conclusion of the copartnership,
Mr. Whitney having set out for the North, Mr. Miller
commenced his long correspondence relative to the
cotton-gin. The first letter announces that encroachments
upon their rights had already begun. "It will
be necessary," says Mr. Miller, "to have a considerable
number of gins made, to be in readiness to send out
as soon as the patent is obtained, in order to satisfy the
absolute demands, and make people's heads easy on the
subject; <i>for I am informed of two other claimants for the
honor of the invention of cotton-gins, in addition to those
we knew before</i>."</p>

<p>On the 20th of June, 1793, Mr. Whitney presented his
patent to Mr. Jefferson, then Secretary of State; but the
prevalence of the yellow fever in Philadelphia (which was
then the seat of government) prevented his concluding
the business relative to the patent until several months
afterwards. To prevent being anticipated, he took, however,
the precaution to make oath to the invention before
the notary public of the city of New Haven, which he
did on the 28th of October of the same year.</p>

<p>Mr. Jefferson, who had much curiosity in regard to
mechanical inventions, took a peculiar interest in this
machine, and addressed to the inventor an obliging letter,
desiring farther particulars respecting it, and expressing a
wish to procure one for his own use.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Mr. Whitney accordingly
sketched the history of the invention, and of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
construction and performances of the machine. "It is
about a year," says he, "since I first turned my attention
to constructing this machine, at which time I was in the
State of Georgia. Within about ten days after my first
conception of the plan, I made a small though imperfect
model. Experiments with this encouraged me to make
one on a larger scale; but the extreme difficulty of procuring
workmen and proper materials in Georgia prevented
my completing the larger one until some time in
April last. This, though much larger than my first attempt,
is not above one third as large as the machines may
be made with convenience. The cylinder is only two
feet two inches in length, and six inches in diameter. It
is turned by hand, and requires the strength of one man
to keep it in constant motion. It is the stated task of one
negro to clean fifty weight (I mean fifty pounds after it is
separated from the seed) of the green cotton seed per day."</p>

<p>In the year 1812 Mr. Whitney made application to
Congress for the renewal of his patent for the cotton-gin.
In his memorial he presented a history of the struggles
he had been forced to encounter in defence of his
right, observing that he had been unable to obtain any
decision on the merits of his claim until he had been
<i>eleven years</i> in the law, and <i>thirteen years</i> of his patent
term had expired. He sets forth that his invention had
been a source of opulence to thousands of the citizens of
the United States; that, as a labor-saving machine, it
would enable one man to perform the work of a thousand
men; and that it furnishes to the whole family of mankind,
at a very cheap rate, the most essential article of
their clothing. Hence he humbly conceived himself entitled
to a further remuneration from his country, and
thought he ought to be admitted to a more liberal par<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>ticipation
with his fellow-citizens in the benefits of his invention.
Although so great advantages had been already
experienced, and the prospect of future benefits was so
promising, still, many of those whose interest had been
most enhanced by this invention, had obstinately persisted
in refusing to make any compensation to the inventor.
The very men whose wealth had been acquired by the
use of this machine, and who had grown rich beyond all
former example, had combined their exertions to prevent
the patentee from deriving any emolument from his invention.
From that State in which he had first made and
where he had first introduced his machine, and which had
derived the most signal benefits from it, he had received
nothing; and from no State had he received the amount
of half a cent per pound on the cotton cleaned with his
machines in one year. Estimating the value of the labor
of one man at twenty cents per day, the whole amount
which had been received by him for his invention was not
equal to the value of the labor saved in <i>one hour</i> by his
machines then in use in the United States. "This invention,"
he proceeds, "now gives to the southern section of
the Union, over and above the profits which would be
derived from the cultivation of any other crop, an annual
emolument of at least <i>three millions</i> of dollars."<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The
foregoing statement does not rest on conjecture, it is no
visionary speculation,&mdash;all these advantages have been
realized; the planters of the Southern States have counted
the cash, felt the weight of it in their pockets, and heard
the exhilarating sound of its collision. Nor do the advantages
stop here. This immense source of wealth is but just
beginning to be opened. Cotton is a more cleanly and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>healthful article of cultivation than tobacco and indigo,
which it has superseded, and does not so much impoverish
the soil. This invention has already trebled the value
of the land through a large extent of territory; and the
degree to which the cultivation of cotton may be still augmented,
is altogether incalculable. This species of cotton
has been known in all countries where cotton has been
raised, from time immemorial, but was never known as an
article of commerce until since this method of cleaning it
was discovered. In short (to quote the language of Judge
Johnson), "if we should assert that the benefits of this invention
exceed <i>one hundred millions of dollars</i>, we could
prove the assertion by correct calculation." It is objected
that if the patentee succeeds in procuring the renewal of
his patent, he will be too rich. There is no probability
that the patentee, if the term of his patent were extended
for twenty years, would ever obtain for his invention one
half as much as many an individual will gain by use of it.
Up to the present time, the whole amount of what he has
acquired from this source (after deducting his expenses)
does not exceed one half the sum which a single individual
has gained by the use of the machine in one year. It
is true that considerable sums have been obtained from
some of the States where the machine is used; but no
small portion of these sums has been expended in prosecuting
his claim in a State where nothing has been obtained,
and where his machine has been used to the
greatest advantage.</p>

<p>There was much more which was curious, laid out in
different books; but the call came for supper, and the
young people obeyed.</p>

<h3>THE STEAM-HAMMER.</h3>


<p>"My dear Uncle Fritz, I have found something very
precious."</p>

<p>"I hope it is a pearl necklace, my dear," was his reply,
"though I see no one who needs such ornaments less."</p>

<p>Hester waltzed round the room, and dropped a very
low courtesy before Uncle Fritz in acknowledgment of his
compliment; and all the others clapped their hands. They
asked her, more clamorously than Uncle Fritz, what she
had found.</p>

<p>"I have found a man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is more than Diogenes could."</p>

<p>"Horace, I shall send you out of the room, or back on
first principles. Do you not know that it is not nice to
interrupt?"</p>

<p>"I have found a man, Uncle Fritz, who is an inventor,
a great inventor; and he is very nice, and he likes people
and people like him, and he always succeeds,&mdash;his things
turn out well, like Dr. Franklin's; and he says the world
has always been grateful to him. He never sulks or complains;
he knows all about the moon, and makes wonderful
pictures of it; and he's enormously rich, I believe,
too,&mdash;but that's not so much matter. The best of all is,
that he began just as we begin. He had a nice father and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
a nice mother and a good happy home, and was brought
up like good decent children. Now really, Uncle Fritz,
you mustn't laugh; but do you not think that most of the
people whose lives we read have to begin horridly? They
have to be beaten when they are apprentices, or their
fathers and mothers have to die, or they have to walk
through Philadelphia with loaves of bread under their arms,
or to be brought up in poor-houses or something. Now,
nothing of that sort happened to my inventor. And I am
very much encouraged. For my father never beat me, and
my mother never scolded me half as much as I deserved,
and I never was in a poor-house, and I never carried a
loaf of bread under my arm, and so I really was afraid I
should come to no good. But now I have found my
new moon-man, I am very much encouraged."</p>

<p>The others laughed heartily at Hester's zeal, and
Blanche asked what Hester's hero had invented, and
what was his name. The others turned to Uncle Fritz
half incredulously. But Uncle Fritz came to Hester's
relief.</p>

<p>"Hester is quite right," he said; "and his name it is
James Nasmyth. He has invented a great many things,
quite necessary in the gigantic system of modern machine-building.
He has chosen the steam-hammer for his device.
Here is a picture of it on the outside of his Life.
You see I was ready for you, Hester."</p>

<p>The children looked with interest on the device, and
Fergus said that it was making heraldry do as it should,
and speak in the language of the present time.</p>

<p>Then Uncle Fritz bade Hester find for them a passage
in the biography where Mr. Nasmyth tells how he
changed the old motto of the family. Oddly enough,
the legend says that the first Nasmyth took his name<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
after a romantic escape, when one of his pursuers, finding
him disguised as a blacksmith, cried out, "Ye're <i>nae
smyth</i>."</p>

<p>It is a little queer that this name should have been
given to the family of a man, who, in his time, forged
heavier pieces of iron than had ever been forged before,
and, indeed, invented the machinery by which this should
be done. The old Scotch family had for a motto the
words</p>

<p class="center">
"Non arte, sed Marte."<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">With a very just pride, James Nasmyth has changed the
motto, and made it</p>

<p class="center">
"Non Marte, sed arte."<br />
</p>

<p class="noidt">That is, while they said, "Not by art, but by war," this
man, who has done more work for the world, directly
or indirectly, than any of Aladdin's genii, says, "Not by
war, but by art."</p>

<p>Hester was well pleased that their old friend justified
her enthusiasm so entirely. He and she began dipping
into her copy and his copy of the biography, which is
one of the most interesting books of our time.</p>


<h3>JAMES NASMYTH.</h3>

<p>My grandfather, Michael Naesmyth, like his father and
grandfather, was a builder and architect. The buildings
he designed and erected for the Scotch nobility and
gentry were well arranged, carefully executed, and thoroughly
substantial. I remember my father pointing out
to me the extreme care and attention with which he
finished his buildings. He inserted small fragments of
basalt into the mortar of the external joints of the stones,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
at close and regular distances, in order to protect the
mortar from the adverse action of the weather; and to
this day they give proof of their efficiency.</p>

<p>The excellence of my grandfather's workmanship was
a thing that my own father impressed upon me when a
boy. It stimulated in me the desire to aim at excellence
in everything that I undertook, and in all practical matters
to arrive at the highest degree of good workmanship. I
believe that these early lessons had a great influence upon
my future career.</p>

<p>My father, Alexander Nasmyth, was the second son of
Michael Nasmyth. He was born in his father's house in
the Grassmarket, on the 9th of September, 1758.</p>

<p>I have not much to say about my father's education.
For the most part he was his own schoolmaster. I have
heard him say that his mother taught him his A B C,
and that he afterward learned to read at Mammy Smith's.
This old lady kept a school for boys and girls at the top
of a house in the Grassmarket. There my father was
taught to read his Bible and to learn his Carritch (the
Shorter Catechism).</p>

<p>My father's profession was that of a portrait-painter, to
begin with; but later he devoted himself to landscape-painting.
But he did not confine himself to this pursuit.
He was an all-round man, with something of the universal
about him. He was a painter, an architect, and a
mechanic. Above all, he was an incessantly industrious
man.</p>

<p>I was born on the morning of the 19th of August, 1808,
at my father's house in Edinburgh. I was named James
Hall, after a dear friend of my father. My mother
afterward told me that I must have been a "very noticin'
bairn," as she observed me, when I was only a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
days old, following with my little eyes any one who happened
to be in the room, as if I had been thinking to my
little self, "Who are you?"</p>

<p>When I was about four or five years old I was observed
to give a decided preference to the use of my left hand.
At first everything was done to prevent my using it in
preference to the right, until my father, after viewing a
little sketch I had drawn with my left hand, allowed me
to go on in my own way. I used my right hand in all
that was necessary, and my left in all sorts of practical
manipulative affairs. My left hand has accordingly been
my most willing and obedient servant, and in this way
I became ambidexter.</p>

<p>In due time I was sent to school; and while attending
the High School, from 1817 to 1820, there was
the usual rage among boys for spinning-tops, "peeries,"
and "young cannon." By means of my father's
excellent foot-lathe I turned out the spinning-tops in capital
style, so much so that I became quite noted among
my school companions. They all wanted to have specimens
of my productions. They would give any price for
them. The peeries were turned with perfect accuracy,
and the steel-shod or spinning pivot was centred so as to
correspond with the heaviest diameter at the top. They
would spin twice as long as the bought peeries. When at
full speed they would "sleep;" that is, turn round without
a particle of wavering. This was considered high art as
regarded top-spinning.</p>

<p>Flying-kites and tissue-paper balloons were articles
that I was also somewhat famed for producing. There
was a good deal of special skill required for the production
of a flying-kite. It must be perfectly still and steady
when at its highest flight in the air. Paper messengers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
were sent up to it along the string which held it to the
ground. The top of the Calton Hill was the most
favorite place for enjoying this pleasant amusement.</p>

<p>Another article for which I became equally famous
was the manufacture of small brass cannon. These I
cast and bored, and mounted on their appropriate gun-carriages.
They proved very effective, especially in the
loudness of the report when fired. I also converted large
cellar-keys into a sort of hand-cannon. A touch-hole
was bored into the barrel of the key, with a sliding brass
collar that allowed the key-guns to be loaded and primed,
ready for firing.</p>

<p>The principal occasion on which the brass cannon and
hand-guns were used was on the 4th of June,&mdash;King
George the Third's birthday. This was always celebrated
with exuberant and noisy loyalty. The guns of the Castle
were fired at noon, and the number of shots corresponded
with the number of years that the king had reigned.
The grand old Castle was enveloped in smoke, and the
discharges reverberated along the streets and among the
surrounding hills. Everything was in holiday order. The
coaches were hung with garlands, the shops were ornamented,
the troops were reviewed on Bruntsfield Links,
and the citizens drank the king's health at the Cross,
throwing the glasses over their backs. The boys fired off
gunpowder, or threw squibs or crackers, from morning
till night. It was one of the greatest schoolboy events
of the year.</p>

<p>My little brass cannon and hand-guns were very busy
that day. They were fired until they became quite hot.
These were the pre-lucifer days. The fire to light the
powder at the touch-hole was obtained by the use of a
flint, a steel, and a tinder-box. The flint was struck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
sharply on the steel, a spark of fire consequently fell into
the tinder-box, and the match (of hemp string, soaked in
saltpetre) was readily lit and fired off the little guns.</p>

<p>One of my attached cronies was Tom Smith. Our
friendship began at the High School in 1818. A similarity
of disposition bound us together. Smith was the son
of an enterprising general merchant at Leith. His father
had a special genius for practical chemistry. He had
established an extensive color-manufactory at Portobello,
near Edinburgh, where he produced white lead, red lead,
and a great variety of colors,&mdash;in the preparation of
which he required a thorough knowledge of chemistry.
Tom Smith inherited his father's tastes, and admitted me
to share in his experiments, which were carried on in a
chemical laboratory situated behind his father's house at
the bottom of Leith Walk.</p>

<p>We had a special means of communication. When
anything particular was going on at the laboratory, Tom
hoisted a white flag on the top of a high pole in his
father's garden. Though I was more than a mile away,
I kept a lookout in the direction of the laboratory with
a spy-glass. My father's house was at the top of Leith
Walk, and Smith's house was at the bottom of it. When
the flag was hoisted I could clearly see the invitation to
me to come down. I was only too glad to run down the
Walk and join my chum, to take part in some interesting
chemical process. Mr. Smith, the father, made me heartily
welcome. He was pleased to see his son so much attached
to me, and he perhaps believed that I was worthy
of his friendship. We took zealous part in all the chemical
proceedings, and in that way Tom was fitting himself
for the business of his life.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith was a most genial-tempered man. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
shrewd and quick-witted, like a native of York, as he was.
I received the greatest kindness from him as well as from
his family. His house was like a museum. It was full of
cabinets, in which were placed choice and interesting
objects in natural history, geology, mineralogy, and metallurgy.
All were represented. Many of these specimens
had been brought to him from abroad by his
ship-captains, who transported his color manufactures and
other commodities to foreign parts.</p>

<p>My friend Tom Smith and I made it a rule&mdash;and in
this we were encouraged by his father&mdash;that, so far as
was possible, we ourselves should actually <i>make</i> the acids
and other substances used in our experiments. We were
not to buy them ready-made, as this would have taken the
zest out of our enjoyment. We should have lost the
pleasure and instruction of producing them by means of
our own wits and energies. To encounter and overcome
a difficulty is the most interesting of all things. Hence,
though often baffled, we eventually produced perfect specimens
of nitrous, nitric, and muriatic acids. We distilled
alcohol from duly fermented sugar and water, and rectified
the resultant spirit from fusel-oil by passing the alcoholic
vapor through animal charcoal before it entered the worm
of the still. We converted part of the alcohol into sulphuric
ether. We produced phosphorus from old bones,
and elaborated many of the mysteries of chemistry.</p>

<p>The amount of practical information which we obtained
by this system of making our own chemical agents, was
such as to reward us, in many respects, for the labor we
underwent. To outsiders it might appear a very troublesome
and roundabout way of getting at the finally desired
result; but I feel certain that there is no better method
of rooting chemical or any other instruction deeply in our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
minds. Indeed, I regret that the same system is not pursued
by the youth of the present day. They are seldom
if ever called upon to exert their own wits and industry to
obtain the requisites for their instruction. A great deal is
now said about technical education; but how little there
is of technical handiness or head work! Everything is
<i>bought ready-made</i> to their hands; and hence there is no
call for individual ingenuity.</p>

<p>I left the High School at the end of 1820. I carried
with me a small amount of Latin and no Greek. I do
not think I was much the better for my small acquaintance
with the dead languages.</p>

<p>By the time I was seventeen years old I had acquired a
considerable amount of practical knowledge as to the use
and handling of mechanical tools, and I desired to turn
it to some account. I was able to construct working
models of steam-engines and other apparatus required for
the illustration of mechanical subjects. I began with
making a small working steam-engine, for the purpose of
grinding the oil-colors used by my father in his artistic
work. The result was quite satisfactory. Many persons
came to see my active little steam-engine at work; and
they were so pleased with it that I received several orders
for small workshop engines, and also for some models of
steam-engines to illustrate the subjects taught at Mechanics'
Institutions.</p>

<p>I contrived a sectional model of a complete condensing
steam-engine of the beam and parallel-motion construction.
The model, as seen from one side, exhibited every
external detail in full and due action when the fly-wheel
was moved round by hand; while on the other, or sectional
side, every detail of the interior was seen, with the
steam-valves and air-pump, as well as the motion of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
piston in the cylinder, with the construction of the piston
and the stuffing-box, together with the slide-valve and
steam-passages, all in due position and relative movement.</p>

<p>I was a regular attendant at the Edinburgh School of
Arts from 1821 to 1826, meanwhile inventing original
contrivances of various sorts.</p>

<p>About the year 1827, when I was nineteen years old,
the subject of steam-carriages to run upon common roads
occupied considerable attention. Several engineers and
mechanical schemers had tried their hands, but as yet no
substantial results had come of their attempts to solve the
problem. Like others, I tried my hand. Having made a
small working model of a steam-carriage, I exhibited it
before the members of the Scottish Society of Arts. The
performance of this active little machine was so gratifying
to the Society, that they requested me to construct one of
such power as to enable four or six persons to be conveyed
along the ordinary roads. The members of the
Society, in their individual capacity, subscribed &pound;60,
which they placed in my hands, as the means of carrying
out their project.</p>

<p>I accordingly set to work at once. I had the heavy
parts of the engine and carriage done at Anderson's foundry
at Leith. There was in Anderson's employment a
most able general mechanic, named Robert Maclaughlan,
who had served his time at Carmichael's, of Dundee. Anderson
possessed some excellent tools, which enabled me
to proceed rapidly with the work. Besides, he was most
friendly, and took much delight in being concerned in my
enterprise. This "big job" was executed in about four
months. The steam-carriage was completed and exhibited
before the members of the Society of Arts. Many
successful trials were made with it on the Queensferry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
Road, near Edinburgh. The runs were generally of four
or five miles, with a load of eight passengers, sitting on
benches about three feet from the ground.</p>

<p>The experiments were continued for nearly three months,
to the great satisfaction of the members.</p>

<p>The chief object of my ambition was now to be taken
on at Henry Maudsley's works in London. I had heard
so much of his engineering work, of his assortment of
machine-making tools, and of the admirable organization
of his manufactory, that I longed to obtain employment
there. But I was aware that my father had not the means
of paying the large premium required for placing me there,
and I was also informed that Maudsley had ceased to take
pupils, they caused him so much annoyance. My father
and I went to London; and Mr. Maudsley received us in
the most kind and frank manner, and courteously invited
us to go round the works. When this was concluded I
ventured to say to Mr. Maudsley that "I had brought up
with me from Edinburgh some working models of steam-engines
and mechanical drawings, and I should feel truly
obliged if he would allow me to show them to him." "By
all means," said he; "bring them to me to-morrow at
twelve o'clock." I need not say how much pleased I
was at this permission to exhibit my handiwork, and how
anxious I felt as to the result of Mr. Maudsley's inspection
of it.</p>

<p>I carefully unpacked my working model of the steam-engine
at the carpenter's shop, and had it conveyed,
together with my drawings, on a handcart to Mr. Maudsley's,
next morning, at the appointed hour. I was allowed
to place my work for his inspection in a room next his
office and counting-house. I then called at his residence,
close by, where he kindly received me in his library. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
asked me to wait until he and his partner, Joshua Field,
had inspected my handiwork.</p>

<p>I waited anxiously. Twenty long minutes passed. At
last he entered the room, and from a lively expression in
his countenance I observed in a moment that the great
object of my long-cherished ambition had been attained.
He expressed, in good round terms, his satisfaction at my
practical ability as a workman, engineer, and mechanical
draughtsman. Then, opening the door which led from
his library into his beautiful private workshop, he said,
"This is where I wish you to work, beside me, as my
assistant workman. From what I have seen there is no
need of an apprenticeship in your case."</p>

<p>One of his favorite maxims was, "First <i>get a clear notion</i>
of what you desire to accomplish, and then in all probability
you will succeed in doing it." Another was, "Keep
a sharp lookout upon your materials; get rid of every
pound of material you can <i>do without</i>; put to yourself
the question, 'What business has it to be there?' avoid
complexities, and make everything as simple as possible."
Mr. Maudsley was full of quaint maxims and remarks,&mdash;the
result of much shrewdness, keen observation, and great
experience. They were well worthy of being stored up in
the mind, like a set of proverbs, full of the life and experience
of men. His thoughts became compressed into
pithy expressions exhibiting his force of character and
intellect. His quaint remarks on my first visit to his
workshop and on subsequent occasions proved to me
invaluable guides to "right thinking" in regard to all
matters connected with mechanical structure.</p>

<p>On the morning of Monday, May 30, 1829, I began
my regular attendance at Mr. Maudsley's workshop, and
remained with him until he died, Feb. 14, 1831. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
a very sad thing for me to lose my dear old master, who
always treated me like a friend and companion. At his
death I passed over into the service of his worthy partner,
Joshua Field, until my twenty-third year, when I intended
to begin business for myself.</p>

<p>I first settled myself at Manchester, but afterwards
established a large business outside of Manchester on the
Bridgewater Canal. In August, 1836, the Bridgewater
Foundry was in complete and efficient action. The engine
ordered at Londonderry was at once put in hand,
and the concern was fairly started in its long career of
prosperity. The wooden workshops had been erected
upon the grass, but the greensward soon disappeared.
The hum of the driving-belts, the whirl of the machinery,
the sound of the hammer upon the anvil, gave the place
an air of busy activity. As work increased, workmen
multiplied. The workshops were enlarged. Wood gave
place to brick. Cottages for the accommodation of the
work-people sprung up in the neighborhood, and what
had once been a quiet grassy field became the centre of
a busy population.</p>

<p>It was a source of vast enjoyment to me, while engaged
in the anxious business connected with the establishment
of the foundry, to be surrounded with so many objects
of rural beauty. The site of the works being on the west
side of Manchester, we had the benefit of breathing pure
air during the greater part of the year. The scenery
round about was very attractive. Exercise was a source
of health to the mind as well as the body. As it was
necessary that I should reside as near as possible to the
works, I had plenty of opportunities for enjoying the rural
scenery of the neighborhood. I had the good fortune to
become the tenant of a small cottage in the ancient village<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
of Barton, in Cheshire, at the very moderate rental of fifteen
pounds a year. The cottage was situated on the
banks of the river Irwell, and was only about six minutes'
walk from the works at Patricroft. It suited my moderate
domestic arrangements admirably.</p>

<p>On June 16, 1840, a day of happy memory, I was married
to Miss Anne Hartop.</p>

<p>I was present at the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway, on Sept. 15, 1830. Every one knows
the success of the undertaking. Railways became the
rage. They were projected in every possible direction;
and when made, locomotives were required to work them.
When George Stephenson was engaged in building his
first locomotive, at Killingworth, he was greatly hampered,
not only by the want of handy mechanics, but by the want
of efficient tools. But he did the best that he could.
His genius overcame difficulties. It was immensely to his
credit that he should have so successfully completed his
engines for the Stockton and Darlington, and afterward
for the Liverpool and Manchester, Railway.</p>

<p>Only a few years had passed, and self-acting tools were
now enabled to complete, with precision and uniformity,
machines that before had been deemed almost impracticable.
In proportion to the rapid extension of railways
the demand for locomotives became very great. As our
machine tools were peculiarly adapted for turning out a
large amount of first-class work, we directed our attention
to this class of business. In the course of about ten years
after the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway,
we executed considerable orders for locomotives for
the London and Southampton, the Manchester and Leeds,
and the Gloucester Railway Companies.</p>

<p>The Great Western Railway Company invited us to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
tender for twenty of their very ponderous engines. They
proposed a very tempting condition of the contract. It
was that if, after a month's trial of the locomotives, their
working proved satisfactory, a premium of &pound;100 was to
be added to the price of each engine and tender. The
locomotives were made and delivered; they ran the stipulated
number of test miles between London and Bristol in
a perfectly satisfactory manner; and we not only received
the premium, but, what was much more encouraging, we
received a special letter from the board of directors, stating
their entire satisfaction with the performance of our engines,
and desiring us to refer other contractors to them
with respect to the excellence of our workmanship. This
testimonial was altogether spontaneous, and proved extremely
valuable in other quarters.</p>

<p>The date of the first sketch of my steam-hammer was
Nov. 24, 1839. It consisted of, first, a massive anvil, on
which to rest the work; second, a block of iron constituting
the hammer, or blow-giving portion; and, third, an
inverted steam cylinder, to whose piston-rod the hammer-block
was attached. All that was then required to produce
a most effective hammer, was simply to admit steam
of sufficient pressure into the cylinder, so as to act on the
under side of the piston, and thus to raise the hammer-block
attached to the end of the piston-rod. By a very
simple arrangement of a slide-valve under the control of
an attendant, the steam was allowed to escape, and thus
permit the massive block of iron rapidly to descend by its
own gravity upon the work then upon the anvil.</p>

<p>Thus, by the more or less rapid manner in which the
attendant allowed the steam to enter or escape from the
cylinder, any required number or any intensity of blows
could be delivered. Their succession might be modified<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
in an instant; the hammer might be arrested and suspended
according to the requirements of the work. The
workman might thus, as it were, <i>think in blows</i>. He
might deal them out on to the ponderous glowing mass,
and mould or knead it into the desired form as if it were
a lump of clay, or pat it with gentle taps, according to his
will or at the desire of the forgeman.</p>

<p>Rude and rapidly sketched out as it was, this my first
delineation of the steam-hammer will be found to comprise
all the essential elements of the invention. There
was no want of orders when the valuable qualities of the
steam-hammer came to be seen and experienced; soon
after I had the opportunity of securing a patent for it in
the United States, where it soon found its way into the
principal iron-works of the country. As time passed by,
I had furnished steam-hammers to the principal foundries
in England, and had sent them abroad even to Russia.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But the English Government is proverbially slow in recognizing
such improvements. It was not till years had
passed by, that Mr. Nasmyth was asked to furnish hammers
to government works. Then he was invited to apply
them to pile-driving. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My first order for my pile-driver was a source of great
pleasure to me. It was for the construction of some great
royal docks at Devonport. An immense portion of the
shore of the Hamoaze had to be walled in so as to exclude
the tide.</p>

<p>When I arrived on the spot with my steam pile-driver,
there was a great deal of curiosity in the dockyard as to
the action of the new machine. The pile-driving machine-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>men
gave me a good-natured challenge to vie with them
in driving down a pile. They adopted the old method,
while I adopted the new one. The resident managers
sought out two great pile logs of equal size and length,-seventy
feet long and eighteen inches square. At a given
signal we started together. I let in the steam, and the
hammer at once began to work. The four-ton block
showered down blows at the rate of eighty a minute, and
in the course of <i>four and a half minutes</i> my pile was
driven down to its required depth. The men working at
the ordinary machine had only begun to drive. It took
them upward of <i>twelve hours</i> to complete the driving of
their pile!</p>

<p>Such a saving of time in the performance of similar
work&mdash;by steam <i>versus</i> manual labor&mdash;had never before
been witnessed. The energetic action of the steam-hammer,
sitting on the shoulders of the pile high up aloft, and
following it suddenly down, the rapidly hammered blows
keeping time with the flashing out of the waste steam at
the end of each stroke, was indeed a remarkable sight.
When my pile was driven the hammer-block and guide-case
were speedily re-hoisted by the small engine that did
all the laboring and locomotive work of the machine, the
steam-hammer portion of which was then lowered on to
the shoulders of the next pile in succession. Again it set
to work. At this the spectators, crowding about in boats,
pronounced their approval in the usual British style of
"Three cheers!" My new pile-driver was thus acknowledged
as another triumphant proof of the power of steam.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the course of the year 1843 it was necessary for me
to make a journey to St. Petersburg. My object was to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
endeavor to obtain an order for a portion of the locomotives
required for working the line between that city and
Moscow. The railway had been constructed under the
engineership of Major Whistler, and it was shortly about
to be opened.</p>

<p>The Major gave me a frank and cordial reception, and
informed me of the position of affairs. The Emperor, he
said, was desirous of training a class of Russian mechanics
to supply not only the locomotives, but to keep them
constantly in repair. The locomotives must be made in
Russia. I received, however, a very large order for
boilers and other detail parts of the Moscow machines.</p>

<p>I enjoyed greatly my visit to St. Petersburg, and my
return home through Stockholm and Copenhagen.</p>

<p>Travelling one day in Sweden, the post-house where I was
set down was an inn, although without a sign-board. The
landlady was a bright, cheery, jolly woman. She could not
speak a word of English, nor I a word of Dannemora Swedish.
I was very thirsty and hungry, and wanted something
to eat. How was I to communicate my wishes to the landlady?
I resorted, as I often did, to the universal language
of the pencil. I took out my sketch-book, and in a few
minutes I made a drawing of a table with a dish of smoking
meat upon it, a bottle and a glass, a knife and fork, a
loaf, a salt-cellar, and a corkscrew. She looked at the
drawing and gave a hearty laugh. She nodded pleasantly,
showing that she clearly understood what I wanted. She
asked me for the sketch, and went into the back garden
to show it to her husband, who inspected it with great
delight. I went out and looked about the place, which
was very picturesque. After a short time the landlady
came to the door and beckoned me in, and I found spread
out on the table everything that I desired,&mdash;a broiled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
chicken, smoking hot from the gridiron, a bottle of capital
home-brewed ale, and all the <i>et ceteras</i> of an excellent
repast. I made use of my pencil in many other ways.
I always found that a sketch was as useful as a sentence.
Besides, it generally created a sympathy between me and
my entertainers.</p>

<p>As the Bridgewater Foundry had been so fortunate as
to earn for itself a considerable reputation for mechanical
contrivances, the workshops were always busy. They
were crowded with machine tools in full action, and exhibited
to all comers their effectiveness in the most satisfactory
manner. Every facility was afforded to those who
desired to see them at work; and every machine and
machine tool that was turned out became in the hands
of its employers the progenitor of a numerous family.</p>

<p>Indeed, on many occasions I had the gratification of
seeing my mechanical notions adopted by rival or competitive
machine constructors, often without acknowledgment;
though, notwithstanding this point of honor, there
was room enough for all. Though the parent features
were easily recognizable, I esteemed such plagiarisms as a
sort of left-handed compliment to their author. I also
regarded them as a proof that I had hit the mark in so
arranging my mechanical combinations as to cause their
general adoption; and many of them remain unaltered to
this day.</p>

<p>My favorite pursuit, after my daily excursions at the
foundry, was astronomy. I constructed for myself a telescope
of considerable power, and, mounting my ten-inch
instrument, I began my survey of the heavens. I began
as a learner, and my learning grew with experience.
There were the prominent stars, the planets, the Milky
Way,&mdash;with thousands of far-off suns,&mdash;to be seen. My<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
observations were at first merely general; by degrees they
became particular. I was not satisfied with enjoying these
sights myself. I made my friends and neighbors sharers
in my pleasure, and some of them enjoyed the wonders of
the heavens as much as I did.</p>

<p>In my early use of the telescope I had fitted the speculum
into a light square tube of deal, to which the eyepiece
was attached, so as to have all the essential parts of the
telescope combined together in the most simple and portable
form. I had often to move it from place to place in my
small garden at the side of the Bridgewater Canal, in order
to get it clear of the trees and branches which intercepted
some object in the heavens which I wished to see. How
eager and enthusiastic I was in those days! Sometimes I
got out of bed in the clear small hours of the morning,
and went down to the garden in my night-shirt. I would
take the telescope in my arms and plant it in some suitable
spot, where I might take a peep at some special planet
or star then above the horizon.</p>

<p>It became bruited about that a ghost was seen at Patricroft!
A barge was silently gliding along the canal near
midnight, when the boatman suddenly saw a figure in white.
"It moved among the trees, with a coffin in its arms!"
The apparition was so sudden and strange that he immediately
concluded that it was a ghost. The weird sight
was reported all along the canal, and also at Wolverhampton,
which was the boatman's headquarters. He told the
people at Patricroft, on his return journey, what he had
seen; and great was the excitement produced. The place
was haunted; there was no doubt about it! After all, the
rumor was founded on fact; for the ghost was merely
myself in my night-shirt, and the coffin was my telescope,
which I was quietly shifting from one place to another,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
in order to get a clearer sight of the heavens at midnight.</p>

<p>I had been for some time contemplating the possibility
of retiring altogether from business. I had got enough of
the world's goods, and was willing to make way for younger
men.</p>

<p>Many long years of pleasant toil and exertion had done
their work. A full momentum of prosperity had been
given to my engineering business at Patricroft. My share
in the financial results accumulated, with accelerated rapidity,
to an amount far beyond my most sanguine hopes.
But finding, from long-continued and incessant mental
efforts, that my nervous system was beginning to become
shaken, especially in regard to an affection of the eyes,
which in some respects damaged my sight, I thought the
time had arrived for me to retire from commercial life.</p>

<p>Behold us, then, settled down at Hammerfield for life.
We had plenty to do. My workshop was fully equipped.
My hobbies were there, and I could work them to my
heart's content. The walls of our various rooms were
soon hung with pictures and other works of art, suggestive
of many pleasant associations of former days. Our library
bookcase was crowded with old friends in the shape of
books that had been read and re-read many times, until
they had almost become part of ourselves. Old Lancashire
friends made their way to us when "up in town,"
and expressed themselves delighted with our pleasant
house and its beautiful surroundings.</p>

<p>I was only forty-eight years old, which may be considered
the prime of life. But I had plenty of hobbies, perhaps
the chief of which was astronomy. No sooner had I
settled at Hammerfield than I had my telescopes brought
out and mounted. The fine, clear skies with which we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
were favored furnished me with abundant opportunities
for the use of my instruments. I began again my investigations
on the sun and the moon, and made some original
discoveries.</p>

<p>It is time to come to an end of my recollections. I
have endeavored to give a brief <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of my life and
labors. I hope they may prove interesting as well as
useful to others. Thanks to a good constitution and a
frame invigorated by work, I continue to lead, with my
dear wife, a happy life.</p>

<small>SIR HENRY BESSEMER.</small></h2>

<h3>THE AGE OF STEEL.</h3>


<p>In intervals of the reading meetings so many of the
children's afternoons with Uncle Fritz had been
taken up with excursions to see machinery at work, that
their next meeting at the Oliver House was, as it proved,
the last for the winter.</p>

<p>They had gone to the pumping-station of the waterworks,
and had seen the noiseless work of the great steam-engine
there. They had gone to the &AElig;tna Mills at
Watertown, and with the eye of the flesh had seen "rovers"
and shuttles, and had been taught what "slobbers" are.
They had gone to Waltham, and had been taught something
of the marvellous skill and delicacy expended on the
manufacture of watches. They had gone to Rand and
Avery's printing-house; and here they not only saw the
processes of printing, but they saw steam power "converted"
into electricity. They had gone to the Locomotive
Factory in Albany Street, and understood, much
better than before, the inventions of George Stephenson,
under the lead of the foremen in the shops, who had
been very kind to them.</p>

<p>On their last meeting Uncle Fritz reminded them of
something which one of these gentlemen had taught<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
them about the qualities of steel and iron; and again of
what they had seen of steel-springs at Waltham, when
they saw how the balances of watches are arranged.</p>

<p>"Some bright person has called our time 'the Age of
Steel,'" he said. "You know Ovid's division was 'the
Age of Gold, the Age of Silver, the Age of Brass, the Age
of Iron.' And Ovid, who was in low spirits, thought the
Age of Iron was the worst of all. Now, we begin to improve
if we have entered the Age of Steel; for steel is,
poetically speaking, glorified iron.</p>

<p>"Now the person to whom we owe it, that, in practice,
we can build steel ships to-day where we once built iron
ships, and lay steel rails to-day where even Stephenson
was satisfied with iron, is Sir Henry Bessemer. The
Queen knighted him in recognition of the service he had
rendered to the world by his improvements in the processes
of turning iron into steel.</p>

<p>"It is impossible to estimate the addition which these
improvements have made to the physical power of the
world. I have not the most recent figures, but look at
this," said Uncle Fritz. And he gave to John to read
from a Life of Sir Henry Bessemer:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Prior to this invention the entire production of cast
steel in Great Britain was only about fifty thousand tons
annually; and its average price, which ranged from &pound;50
to &pound;600, prohibited its use for many of the purposes to
which it is now universally applied. After the invention,
in the year 1877, the Bessemer steel produced in Great
Britain alone amounted to 750,000 tons, or fifteen times
the total of the former method of manufacture, while the
selling price averaged only &pound;10 per ton, and the coal
consumed in producing it was less by 3,500,000 tons than
would have been required in order to make the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
quality of steel by the old, or Sheffield, process. The total
reduction of cost is equal to about &pound;30,000,000 sterling
upon the quantity manufactured in England during the
year."</p>

<p>The same book goes on to show that in other nations
&pound;20,000,000 worth of Bessemer steel was produced in
the same year.</p>

<p>"You see," said Uncle Fritz, "that here is an addition
to the real wealth of the world such as makes any average
fairy story about diamonds and rubies rather cheap and
contemptible.</p>

<p>"You will like Sir Henry Bessemer, Hester, because he
was happily trained and had good chances when he was
a boy. And you will be amused to see how his bright
wife was brighter than all the internal-revenue people.
She was so bright that she lost him the appointment
which had enabled him to marry her. But I think he
says somewhere, with a good deal of pride, that but for
that misfortune, and the injustice which accompanied it,
he should have probably never made his great inventions.
It is one more piece of 'Partial evil,&mdash;universal
good.'"</p>

<p>Then the children, with Uncle Fritz's aid, began picking
out what they called the plums from the accounts he
showed them of Sir Henry Bessemer's life.</p>


<h3>BESSEMER'S FAMILY.</h3>

<p>At the time of the great Revolution of 1792 there was
employed in the French mint a man of great ingenuity,
who had become a member of the French Academy of
Sciences at the age of twenty-five. When Robespierre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
became Dictator of France, this scientific academician was
transferred from the mint to the management of a public
bakery, established for the purpose of supplying the populace
of Paris with bread. In that position he soon became
the object of revolutionary frenzy. One day a rumor was
set afloat that the loaves supplied were light in weight;
and, spreading like wildfire, it was made the occasion of a
fearful tumult. The manager of the bakery was instantly
seized and cast into prison. He succeeded in escaping,
but it was at the peril of his life. Knowing the peril he
was in, he lost no time in making his way to England;
and he only succeeded in doing so by adroitly using some
documents he possessed bearing the signature of the Dictator.
Landing in England a ruined man, his talents soon
proved a passport to success. He was appointed to a
position in the English mint; and by the exercise of his
ingenuity in other directions, he ere long acquired sufficient
means to buy a small estate at Charlton, in Hertfordshire.
Such, in brief, were the circumstances that led
to the settlement there of Anthony Bessemer, the father
of Sir Henry Bessemer. The latter may be said to have
been born an inventor. His father was an inventor before
him. After settling in England, his inventive ingenuity
was displayed in making improvements in microscopes
and in type-founding, and in the discovery of what his
son has happily described as the true alchemy. The
latter discovery, which he made about the beginning of
the present century, was a source of considerable profit to
him. It is generally known that when gold articles are
made by the jewellers, there are various discolorations left
on their surface by the process of manufacture; and in
order to clear their surface, they are put into a solution
of alum, salt, and saltpetre, which dissolves a large quantity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
of the copper that is used as an alloy. Anthony Bessemer
discovered that this powerful acid not only dissolved the
copper, but also dissolved a quantity of gold. He accordingly
began to buy up this liquor; and as he was the only
one who knew that it contained gold in solution, he had
no difficulty in arranging for the purchase of it from all
the manufacturers in London. From that liquor he succeeded
in extracting gold in considerable quantities for
many years. By some means that he kept secret (and
the secret died with him), he deposited the particles of
gold on the shavings of another metal, which, being afterwards
melted, left the pure gold in small quantities.
Thirty years afterward the Messrs. Elkington invented the
electrotype process, which had the same effect. Anthony
Bessemer was also eminently successful as a type-founder.
When in France, before the Revolution of 1792, he cut a
great many founts of type for Messrs. Firmin Didot, the
celebrated French type-founders; and after his return to
England he betook himself, as a diversion, to type-cutting
for Mr. Henry Caslon, the celebrated English type-founder.
He engraved an entire series, from pica to diamond,&mdash;a
work which occupied several years. The success of these
types led to the establishment of the firm of Bessemer
and Catherwood as type-founders, carrying on business at
Charlton. The great improvement which Anthony Bessemer
introduced into the art of type-making was not so
much in the engraving as in the composition of the metal.
He discovered that an alloy of copper, tin, and bismuth
was the most durable metal for type; and the working of
this discovery was very successful in his hands. The
secret of his success, however, he kept unknown to the
trade. He knew that if it were suspected that the superiority
of his type consisted in the composition of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
metal, analysis would reveal it, and others would then be
able to compete with him. So, to divert attention from
the real cause, he pointed out to the trade that the shape
of his type was different, as the angle at which all the
lines were produced from the surface was more obtuse in
his type than in those of other manufacturers, at the same
time contending that his type would wear longer. Other
manufacturers ridiculed this account of Bessemer's type,
but experience showed that it lasted nearly twice as long
as other type. The business flourished for a dozen years
under his direction, and during that period the real cause
of its success was kept a secret. The process has since
been re-discovered and patented. Such were some of the
inventive efforts of the father of one of the greatest inventors
of the present age.</p>


<h3>HENRY BESSEMER.</h3>

<p>The youngest son of Anthony Bessemer, Henry, was
born at Charlton, in Hertfordshire, in 1813. His boyhood
was spent in his native village; and while receiving
the rudiments of an ordinary education in the neighboring
town of Hitchin, the leisure and retirement of rural life
afforded ample time, though perhaps little inducement,
for the display of the natural bent of his mind. Notwithstanding
his scanty and imperfect mechanical appliances,
his early years were devoted to the cultivation of his
inventive faculties. His parents encouraged him in his
youthful efforts.</p>

<p>At the age of eighteen he came to London, "knowing
no one," he says, "and myself unknown,&mdash;a mere cipher
in a vast sea of human enterprise." Here he worked as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
a modeller and designer with encouraging success. He
engraved a large number of elegant and original designs
on steel, with a diamond point, for patent-medicine labels.
He got plenty of this sort of work to do, and was well
paid for it. In his boyhood his favorite amusement was
the modelling of objects in clay; and even in this primitive
school of genius he worked with so much success
that at the age of nineteen he exhibited one of his beautiful
models at the Royal Academy, then held at Somerset
House.</p>


<h3>STAMPED PAPER.</h3>

<p>Thus he soon began to make his way in the metropolis;
and in the course of the following year he was maturing
some plans in connection with the production of
stamps which he sanguinely hoped would lead him on to
fortune. At that time the old forms of stamps were in
use that had been employed since the days of Queen
Anne; and as they were easily transferred from old deeds
to new ones, the Government lost a large amount annually
by this surreptitious use of old stamps instead of new
ones. The ordinary impressed or embossed stamps, such
as are now employed on bills of exchange, or impressed
directly on skins or parchment, were liable to be entirely
obliterated if exposed for some months to a damp atmosphere.
A deed so exposed would at last appear as if
unstamped, and would therefore become invalid. Special
precautions were therefore observed in order to prevent
this occurrence. It was the practice to gum small pieces of
blue paper on the parchment; and, to render it still more
secure, a strip of metal foil was passed through it, and
another small piece of paper with the printed initials of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
the sovereign was gummed over the loose end of the foil at
the back. The stamp was then impressed on the blue
paper, which, unlike parchment, is incapable of losing the
impression by exposure to a damp atmosphere. Experience
showed, however, that by placing a little piece of
moistened blotting-paper for a few hours over the paper,
the gum became so softened that the two pieces of paper
and the slip of foil could be easily removed from an old
deed and then used for a new one. In this way stamps
could be used a second and third time; and by thus utilizing
the expensive stamps on old deeds of partnerships that
were dissolved, or leases that were expired, the public
revenue lost thousands of pounds every year. Sir Charles
Persley, of the Stamp Office, told Sir Henry Bessemer
that the Government were probably defrauded of &pound;100,000
per annum in that way. The young inventor at once set
to work, for the express purpose of devising a stamp that
could not be used twice. His first discovery was a mode
by which he could have reproduced easily and cheaply
thousands of stamps of any pattern. "The facility," he
says, "with which I could make a permanent die from a
thin paper original, capable of producing a thousand
copies, would have opened a wide door for successful
frauds if my process had been known to unscrupulous
persons; for there is not a government stamp or a paper
seal of a corporate body that every common office clerk
could not forge in a few minutes at the office of his
employer or at his own home. The production of such
a die from a common paper stamp is a work of only
ten minutes; the materials cost less than one penny; no
sort of technical skill is necessary, and a common copying-press
or a letter stamp yields most successful copies."
To this day a successful forger has to employ a skilful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
die-sinker to make a good imitation in steel of the document
he wishes to forge; but if such a method as that
discovered and described by Sir Henry Bessemer were
known, what a prospect it would open up! Appalled at
the effect which the communication of such a process
would have had upon the business of the Stamp Office,
he carefully kept the knowledge of it to himself; and to
this day it remains a profound secret.</p>

<p>More than ever impressed with the necessity for an
improved form of stamp, and conscious of his own capability
to produce it, he labored for some months to
accomplish his object, feeling sure that, if successful,
he would be amply rewarded by the Government. To
insure the secrecy of his experiments, he worked at them
during the night, after his ordinary business of the
day was over. He succeeded at last in making a stamp
which obviated the great objection to the then existing
form, inasmuch as it would be impossible to transfer
it from one deed to another, to obliterate it by
moisture, or to take an impression from it capable of
producing a duplicate. Flushed with success and confident
of the reward of his labors, he waited upon Sir
Charles Persley at Somerset House, and showed him, by
numerous proofs, how easily all the then existing stamps
could be forged, and his new invention to prevent forgery.
Sir Charles, who was much astonished at the one invention
and pleased with the other, asked Bessemer to call
again in a few days. At the second interview Sir Charles
asked him to work out the principle of the new stamping
invention more fully. Accordingly Bessemer devoted five
or six weeks' more labor to the perfecting of his stamp,
with which the Stamp Office authorities were now well
pleased. The design, as described by the inventor, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
circular, about two and a half inches in diameter, and
consisted of a garter with a motto in capital letters,
surmounted by a crown. Within the garter was a shield,
and the garter was filled with network in imitation of
lace. The die was executed in steel, which pierced the
parchment with more than four hundred holes; and these
holes formed the stamp. It is by a similar process that
valentine makers have since learned to make the perforated
paper used in their trade. Such a stamp removed
all the objections to the old one. So pleased was Sir
Charles with it that he recommended it to Lord Althorp,
and it was soon adopted by the Stamp Office. At the
same time Sir Henry was asked whether he would be
satisfied with the position of Superintendent of Stamps
with &pound;500 or &pound;600 per annum, as compensation for
his invention, instead of a sum of money from the treasury.
This appointment he gladly agreed to accept; for,
being engaged to be married at the time, he thought his
future position in life was settled. Shortly afterwards he
called on the young lady to whom he was engaged, and
communicated the glad tidings to her, at the same time
showing her the design of his new stamp. On explaining
to her that its chief virtue was that the new stamps thus
produced could not, like the old ones, be fraudulently
used twice or thrice, she instantly suggested that if all
stamps had a date put upon them they could not be used
at a future time without detection. The idea was new to
him; and, impressed with its practical character, he at once
conceived a plan for the insertion of movable dates in the
die of his stamp. The method by which this is now done
is too well known to require description here; but in
1833 it was a new invention. Having worked out the
details of a stamp with movable dates, he saw that it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
more simple and more easily worked than his elaborate
die for perforating stamps; but he also saw that if he
disclosed his latest invention it might interfere with his
settled prospects in connection with the carrying out of
his first one. It was not without regret, too, that he saw
the results of many months of toil and the experiments
of many lonely nights at once superseded; but his conviction
of the superiority of his latest design was so strong,
and his own sense of honor and his confidence in that of
the Government was so unsuspecting, that he boldly went
and placed the whole matter before Sir Charles Persley.
Of course the new design was preferred. Sir Charles truly
observed that with this new plan all the old dies, old
presses, and old workmen could be employed. Among
the other advantages it presented to the Government, it
did not fail to strike Sir Charles that no Superintendent
of Stamps would now be necessary,&mdash;a recommendation
which the perforated die did not possess. The Stamp
Office therefore abandoned the ingenuous and ingenious
inventor. The old stamps were called in, and the new
ones issued in a few weeks; the revenue from stamps
grew enormously, and forged or feloniously used stamps
are now almost unheard of. The Stamp Office reaped
a benefit which it is scarcely possible to estimate fully,
while Bessemer did not receive a farthing. Shortly after
the new stamp was adopted by Act of Parliament, Lord
Althorp resigned, and his successors disclaimed all liability.
When the disappointed inventor pressed his claim, he was
met by all sorts of half-promises and excuses, which ended
in nothing. The disappointment was all the more galling
because, if Bessemer had stuck to his first-adopted plan,
his services would have been indispensable to its execution;
and it was therefore through his putting a better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
and more easily worked plan before them that his services
were coolly ignored. "I had no patent to fall back
upon," he says, in describing the incident afterward. "I
could not go to law, even if I wished to do so; for I was
reminded, when pressing for mere money out of pocket,
that I had done all the work voluntarily and of my own
accord. Wearied and disgusted, I at last ceased to waste
time in calling at the Stamp Office,&mdash;for time was precious
to me in those days,&mdash;and I felt that nothing but
increased exertions could make up for the loss of some
nine months of toil and expenditure. Thus sad and dispirited,
and with a burning sense of injustice overpowering
all other feelings, I went my way from the Stamp
Office, too proud to ask as a favor that which was indubitably
my right."</p>


<h3>GOLD PAINT.</h3>

<p>Shortly after he had taken out his first patent for his
improvement in type-founding, his attention was accidentally
turned to the manufacture of bronze powder, which
is used in gold-work, japanning, gold-printing, and similar
operations. While engaged in ornamenting a vignette in
his sister's album, he had to purchase a small quantity of this
bronze, and was struck with the great difference between
the price of the raw material and that of the manufactured
article. The latter sold for 112<i>s.</i> a pound, while the raw
material only cost 11<i>d.</i> a pound. He concluded that the
difference was caused by the process of manufacture,
and made inquiries with the view of learning the nature
of the process. He found, however, that this manufacture
was hardly known in England. The article was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
supplied to English dealers from Nuremberg and other
towns in Germany. He did not succeed, therefore, in
finding any one who could tell him how it was produced.
In these circumstances he determined to try to make it
himself, and worked for a year and a half at the solution
of this task. Other men had tried it and failed, and he
was on the point of failing too. After eighteen months of
fruitless labor he came to the conclusion that he could not
make it, and gave it up. But it is the highest attribute of
genius to succeed where others fail, and, impelled by this
instinct, he resumed his investigations after six months'
repose. At last success crowned his efforts. The profits
of his previous inventions now supplied him with funds
sufficient to provide the mechanical appliances he had
designed.</p>

<p>Knowing very little of the patent law, and considering
it so insecure that the safest way to reap the full benefit of
his new invention was to keep it to himself, he determined
to work his process of bronze-making in strict secrecy; and
every precaution was therefore adopted for this purpose.
He first put up a small apparatus with his own hands, and
worked it entirely himself. By this means he produced
the required article at 4<i>s.</i> a pound. He then sent out a
traveller with samples of it, and the first order he got was
at 80<i>s.</i> a pound. Being thus fully assured of success, he
communicated his plans to a friend, who agreed to put
&pound;10,000 into the business, as a sleeping partner, in order
to work the new manufacture on a larger scale. The entire
working of the concern was left in the hands of Sir Henry,
who accordingly proceeded to enlarge his means of production.
To insure secrecy, he made plans of all the
machinery required, and then divided them into sections.
He next sent these sectional drawings to different engi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>neering
works, in order to get his machinery made piecemeal
in different parts of England. This done, he collected
the various pieces, and fitted them up himself,&mdash;a work
that occupied him nine months. Finding everything at
last in perfect working order, he engaged four or five
assistants in whom he had confidence, and paid them very
high wages on condition that they kept everything in the
strictest secrecy. Bronze powder was now produced in
large quantities by means of five self-acting machines,
which not only superseded hand labor entirely, but were
capable of producing as much daily as sixty skilled
operatives could do by the old hand system.</p>

<p>To this day the mechanical means by which his famous
gold paint is produced remains a secret. The machinery
is driven by a steam-engine in an adjoining room; and
into the room where the automatic machinery is at work
none but the inventor and his assistants have ever entered.
When a sufficient quantity of work is done, a bell is rung
to give notice to the engine-man to stop the engine; and in
this way the machinery has been in constant use for over
forty years without having been either patented or pirated.
Its profit was as great as its success. At first he made
1,000 per cent profit; and though there are other products
that now compete with this bronze, it still yields
300 per cent profit. "All this time," says the successful
inventor thirty years afterward, "I have been afraid to improve
the machinery, or to introduce other engineers into
the works to improve them. Strange to say, we have thus
among us a manufacture wholly unimproved for thirty
years. I do not believe there is another instance of such
a thing in the kingdom. I believe that if I had patented
it, the fourteen years would not have run out without other
people making improvements in the manufacture. Of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
five machines I use, three are applicable to other processes,
one to color-making especially; so much so that notwithstanding
the very excellent income which I derive from
the manufacture, I had once nearly made up my mind to
throw it open and make it public, for the purpose of using
part of my invention for the manufacture of colors. Three
out of my five assistants have died; and if the other two
were to die and myself too, no one would know what the
invention is." Since this was said (in 1871), Sir Henry
has rewarded the faithfulness of his two surviving assistants
by handing over to them the business and the factory.</p>


<h3>BESSEMER STEEL.</h3>

<p>Sir Henry Bessemer was first led to turn his attention
to the improvement of the manufacture of iron by a remark
of Commander Minie, who was superintending certain
trials of the results of Sir Henry's experiments in
obtaining rotation of shot fired from a smooth-bore gun.
"The shots," said Minie, "rotate properly; but if you
cannot get stronger metal for your guns, such heavy projectiles
will be of little use."</p>

<p>At this time Sir Henry had no connection with the iron
or steel trade, and knew little or nothing of metallurgy.
But this fact he has always represented as being rather an
advantage than a drawback. "I find," he says, "in my
experience with regard to inventions, that the most intelligent
manufacturers invent many small improvements in
various departments of their manufactures,&mdash;but, generally
speaking, these are only small ameliorations based on
the nature of the operation they are daily pursuing; while,
on the contrary, persons wholly unconnected with any par<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>ticular
business have their minds so free and untrammelled
to new things as they are, and as they would present themselves
to an independent observer, that they are the men
who eventually produce the greatest changes." It was in
this spirit that he began his investigations in metallurgy.
His first business was to make himself acquainted with the
information contained in the best works then published
on the subject. He also endeavored to add some practical
knowledge to what he learned from books. With this
view he visited the iron-making districts in the north, and
there obtained an insight into the working merits and
defects of the processes then in use. On his return to
London he arranged for the use of an old factory in St.
Pancras, where he began his own series of experiments.
He converted the factory into a small experimental "iron-works,"
in which his first object was to improve the quality
of iron. For this purpose he made many costly
experiments without the desired measure of success, but
not without making some progress in the right direction.
After twelve months spent in these experiments he produced
an improved quality of cast iron, which was almost
as white as steel, and was both tougher and stronger than
the best cast iron then used for ordnance. Of this metal
he cast a small model gun, which was turned and bored.
This gun he took to Paris, and presented it personally to
the Emperor,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> as the result of his labors thus far. His
Majesty encouraged him to continue his experiments, and
desired to be further informed of the results.</p>

<p>As Sir Henry continued his labors, he extended their
scope from the production of refined iron to that of steel;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>and in order to protect himself, he took out a patent for
each successive improvement. One idea after another
was put to the test of experiment; one furnace after another
was pulled down, and numerous mechanical appliances
were designed and tried in practice. During these
experiments he specified a multitude of improvements in
the crucible process of making steel; but he still felt that
much remained to be done. At the end of eighteen
months, he says, "the idea struck me" of rendering cast
iron malleable by the introduction of atmospheric air into
the fluid metal. His first experiment to test this idea was
made in a crucible in the laboratory. He there found
that by blowing air into the molten metal in the crucible,
by means of a movable blow-pipe, he could convert ten
pounds or twelve pounds of crude iron into the softest
malleable iron. The samples thus produced were so satisfactory
in all their mechanical tests that he brought them
under the notice of Colonel Eardley Wilmot, then the
Superintendent of the Royal Gun Factories, who expressed
himself delighted and astonished at the result, and who
offered him facilities for experimenting in Woolwich Arsenal.
These facilities were extended to him in the laboratory
by Professor Abel, who made numberless analyses of
the material as he advanced with his experiments. The
testing department was also put at his disposal, for testing
the tensile strength and elasticity of different samples of
soft malleable iron and steel. The first piece that was
rolled at Woolwich was preserved by Sir Henry as a memento.
It was a small bar of metal, about a foot long
and an inch wide, and was converted from a state of pig
iron in a crucible of only ten pounds. That small piece
of bar, after being rolled, was tried, to see how far it was
capable of welding; and he was surprised to see how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
easily it answered the severest tests. After this he commenced
experiments on a larger scale. He had proved
in the laboratory that the principle of purifying pig iron
by atmospheric air was possible; but he feared, from what
he knew of iron metallurgy, that as he approached the
condition of pure soft malleable iron, he must of necessity
require a temperature that he could not hope to attain
under these conditions. In order to produce larger quantities
of metal in this way, one of his first ideas was to
apply the air to the molten iron in crucibles; and accordingly,
in October, 1855, he took out a patent embodying
this idea. He proposed to erect a large circular furnace,
with openings for the reception of melting-pots containing
fluid iron, and pipes were made to conduct air into the
centre of each pot, and to force it among the particles of
metal. Having thus tested the purifying effect of cold
air introduced into the melting iron in pots, he labored
for three months in trying to overcome the mechanical
difficulties experienced in this complicated arrangement.
He wondered whether it would not be possible to dispense
with the pipes and pots, and perform the whole
operation in one large circular or egg-shaped vessel. The
difficult thing in doing so, was to force the air all through
the mass of liquid metal. While this difficulty was revolving
in his mind, the labor and anxiety entailed by previous
experiments brought on a short but severe illness;
and while he was lying in bed, pondering for hours upon
the prospects of succeeding in another experiment with
the pipes and pots, it occurred to him that the difficulty
might be got over by introducing air into a large vessel
from below into the molten mass within.</p>

<p>Though he entertained grave doubts as to the practicability
of carrying out this idea, chiefly owing to the high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
temperature required to maintain the iron in a state of fluidity
while the impurities were being burned out, he determined
to put it to a working test; and on recovering health
he immediately began to design apparatus for this purpose.
He constructed a circular vessel, measuring three
feet in diameter and five feet in height, and capable of
holding seven hundred-weight of iron. He next ordered
a small, powerful air-engine and a quantity of crude iron
to be put down on the premises in St. Pancras, that he
had hired for carrying on his experiments. The name
of these premises was Baxter House, formerly the residence
of old Richard Baxter; and the simple experiment
we are now going to describe has made that house more
famous than ever. The primitive apparatus being ready,
the engine was made to force streams of air, under high
pressure, through the bottom of the vessel, which was
lined with fire-clay; and the stoker was told to pour the
metal, when it was sufficiently melted, in at the top of it.
A cast-iron plate&mdash;one of those lids which commonly
cover the coal-holes in the pavement&mdash;was hung over the
converter; and all being got ready, the stoker in some
bewilderment poured in the metal. Instantly out came a
volcanic eruption of such dazzling coruscations as had
never been seen before. The dangling pot-lid dissolved
in the gleaming volume of flame, and the chain by which
it hung grew red and then white, as the various stages of
the process were unfolded to the gaze of the wondering
spectators. The air-cock to regulate the blast was beside
the converting-vessel; but no one dared to go near it,
much less deliberately to shut it. In this dilemma, however,
they were soon relieved by finding that the process
of decarburization or combustion had expended all its
fury; and, most wonderful of all, the result was steel!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
The new metal was tried. Its quality was good. The
problem was solved. The new process appeared successful.
The inventor was elated, as well he might be!</p>

<p>The new process was received with astonishment by all
the iron-working world. It was approved by many, but
scoffed at by others. As trials went on, however, the
feeling against it increased. The iron so made was often
"rotten," and no one could tell exactly why.</p>

<p>Bessemer, however, continued to investigate everything
for himself, regardless of all suggestions. Some ideas of
permanent value were offered to him, but were set at
nought. It was not till another series of independent
experiments were made that he himself discovered the
secret of failure. It then appeared that, by mere chance,
the iron used in his first experiments was Blaenavon pig,
which is exceptionally free from phosphorus; and consequently,
when other sorts of iron were thrown at random
into the converter, the phosphorus manifested its refractory
nature in the unworkable character of the metal produced.
Analyses made by Professor Abel for Sir Henry
showed that this was the real cause of failure. Once convinced
of this fact, Sir Henry set to work for the purpose
of removing this hostile element. He saw how phosphorus
was removed in the puddling-furnace, and he now
tried to do the same thing in his converter. Another
series of costly and laborious experiments was conducted;
and first one patent and then another was taken
out, tried, and abandoned. His last idea was to make a
vessel in which the converting process did not take place,
but into which he could put the pig iron as soon as it was
melted, along with the same kind of materials that were
used in the puddling-furnace. He was then of opinion
that he must come as near to puddling as possible, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
order to get the phosphorus out of the iron. Just as he
was preparing to put this plan into operation, there arrived
in England some pig iron which he had ordered from
Sweden some months previously. When this iron, which
was free from phosphorus, was put into the converter, it
yielded, in the very first experiment, a metal of so high a
quality that he at once abandoned his efforts to dephosphorize
ordinary iron. The Sheffield manufacturers were
then selling steel at &pound;60 a ton; and he thought that as
he could buy pig iron at &pound;7 a ton, and by blowing it a
few minutes in the converter could make it into what was
being sold at such a high price, the problem was solved.</p>

<p>But there was yet one thing wanting. He had now
succeeded in producing the purest malleable iron ever
made, and that, too, by a quicker and less expensive
process than was ever known before. But what he wanted
was to make steel. The former is iron in its greatest
possible purity; the latter is pure iron containing a small
percentage of carbon to harden it. There has been an
almost endless controversy in trying to make a definition
that will fix the dividing line that separates the one metal
from the other.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>For our present purpose, suffice it to quote the account
given in a popular treatise on metallurgy, published at the
time when Bessemer was in the midst of his experiments.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
"Wrought iron," it says, "or soft iron, may contain no
carbon; and if perfectly pure, would contain none, nor
indeed any other impurity. This is a state to be desired
and aimed at, but it has never yet been perfectly attained
in practice. The best as well as the commonest foreign
irons always contain more or less carbon.... Carbon
may exist in iron in the ratio of 65 parts to 10,000 without
assuming the properties of steel. If the proportion be
greater than that, and anywhere between the limits of 65
parts of carbon to 10,000 parts of iron and 2 parts of
carbon to 100 of iron, the alloy assumes the properties of
steel. In cast iron the carbon exceeds 2 per cent, but in
appearance and properties it differs widely from the hardest
steel. These properties, although we quote them, are
somewhat doubtful; and the chemical constitution of
these three substances may, perhaps, be regarded as still
undetermined." Now, in the Bessemer converter the carbon
was almost entirely consumed. In the small gun just
described,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> there were only 14 parts of carbon for 1,000,000
parts of iron. Bessemer's next difficulty was to carburize
his pure iron, and thus to make it into steel. "The
wrought iron," says Mr. I. L. Bell, "as well as the steel
made according to Sir Henry Bessemer's original plan,
though a purer specimen of metal was never heard of
except in the laboratory, was simply worthless. In this
difficulty, a ray of scientific truth, brought to light one
hundred years before, came to the rescue. Bergmann
was one of the earliest philosophers who discarded all
theory, and introduced into chemistry that process of
analysis which is the indispensable antecedent of scientific
system. This Swedish experimenter had ascertained the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
existence of manganese in the iron of that country, and
connected its presence with suitability for steel purposes."
Manganese is a kind of iron exceptionally rich in carbon,
and also exceptionally free from other impurities. Berzelius,
Rinman, Karsten, Berthier, and other metallurgists
had before now discussed its effect when combined with
ordinary iron; and the French were so well aware that
ferro-manganese ores were superior for steel-making purposes
that they gave them the name of <i>mines d'acier</i>. So
Bessemer, after many experiments, discovered a method
whereby, with the use of ferro-manganese, he could make
what is known as mild steel. The process of manufacture,
when described by Sir Henry Bessemer at Cheltenham in
1856,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> was so nearly complete, that only two important
additions were made afterwards. One was the introduction
of the ferro-manganese for the purpose of imparting
to his pure liquid iron the properties of "mild steel."
The other was an improvement in the mechanical apparatus.
He found that when the air had been blown into
the iron till all the carbon was expelled, the continuance
of "the blow" afterward consumed the iron at a very
rapid rate, and a great loss of iron thus took place. It
was therefore necessary to cease blowing at a particular
moment. At first he saw no practical way by which he
could prevent the metal going into the air-holes in the
bottom of the vessel below the level of the liquid mass,
so as to stop them up immediately on ceasing to force the
air through them; for if he withdrew the pressure of air,
the whole apparatus would be destroyed for a time.
Here, again, his inventive genius found a remedy. He
had the converter holding the molten iron mounted on an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>axis, which enabled him at any moment he liked to turn
it round and to bring the holes above the level of the
metal; whenever this was done the process of conversion
or combustion ceased of itself, and the apparatus had
only to be turned back again in order to resume the
operation. This turning on an axis of a furnace weighing
eleven tons, and containing five tons of liquid metal, at a
temperature scarcely approachable, was a system entirely
different from anything that had preceded it; for it he
took out what he considered one of his most important
patents, "and," he says, "I am vain enough to believe
that so long as my process lasts, the motion of the vessel
containing the fluid on its axis will be retained as an absolute
necessity for any form which the process may take
at any future time." The patent for this invention was
taken out about four years after his original patent for the
converter.</p>

<p>Uncle Fritz showed them a picture of this gigantic
kettle, which holds this mass of molten metal and yet
turns so easily.</p>

<p>"But," said Helen, "you have a model of it here,
Uncle Fritz." And she pointed to her Uncle Fritz's inkstand,
which is something the shape of a fat beet-root,
with the point turned up to receive the ink. Uncle Fritz
nodded his approval. These inkstands, which turn over
on a little brazen axis, were probably first made by some
one who had seen the great eleven-ton converters.</p>

<p>Uncle Fritz showed the children the picture in the
"Practical Magazine," and they spent some time together
in looking over the pages of the volume for 1876.</p>

<p>The Bessemer process was now perfect. Nearly four
years had elapsed since its conception and first application;
and in addition to the necessary labor and anxiety<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
he had experienced, no less than &pound;20,000 had been expended
in making experiments that were necessary to
complete its success. It only remained to bring the
process into general use.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The young people asked quite eagerly whether they
could see the processes of "conversion" anywhere, and
were glad to be told that Bessemer steel is made in many
parts of America. One of their young friends, who was
educated at the "Technology," is in charge of a department
at Steelton, in Pennsylvania, and they have all written
letters to him.</p>

<p>The American steel-makers have a great variety of ores
to choose from, and they have found it possible, by using
different ores, to avoid the difficulties which Mr. Bessemer
first met in using the ores of England.</p>

<p>And so far are the processes now simplified, that in
many American establishments the molten iron is received
liquid from the blast furnaces, and does not have
to be reduced a second time in a cupola furnace, as was
the iron used by Mr. Bessemer. There is no cooling, in
such establishments, between the ore and the finished
steel.</p>

<small>THE LAST MEETING.</small></h2>

<h3>GOODYEAR.</h3>


<p>When the day for the next meeting came, Uncle
Fritz had a large collection of books and magazines
in the little rolling racks and tables where such
things are kept. But no one of them was opened.</p>

<p>No. The young people appeared in great strength, all
at the same moment, and notified him that he was to put
on his hat and his light overcoat, and go with them on
what they called the first "Alp" of the season. For there
is a pretence in the little company that they are an Alpine
Club, and that for eight months of the year it is their
duty to climb the highest mountains near Boston.</p>

<p>Now, the very highest of these peaks is the summit hill
of the Blue Hills, to which indeed Massachusetts owes its
name. For "Matta" in the Algonquin tongue meant
"great," and "Chuset" meant "a hill." And a woman
who was living on a little hummock near Squantum, just
before Winthrop and the rest landed, was the sacred Sachem
of the Massachusetts Indians. Hence the name of
Mattachusetts Bay; and then, by euphony or bad spelling,
or both, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Uncle Fritz obeyed the rabble rout, as he is apt to do.
He retired for a minute to put on heavier shoes, and, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
he reappeared, he took the seat of honor in the leading
omnibus. And a very merry expedition they had to the
summit, where, as the accurate Fergus told them, they
were six hundred feet above the level of the sea. There
was but little wood, and they were able to lie and sit in a
large group on the ground just on the lee side of the hill,
where they could look off on the endless sea.</p>

<p>"Whom should you have told us about, had it rained?"
said Mabel Fordyce.</p>

<p>"Oh! you were to have had your choice. There are
still left many inventors. I had looked at Mr. Parton's Life
of Goodyear, and the very curious brief prepared for the
court about his patents. Half of you would not be here
to-day but for that ingenious and long-suffering man."</p>

<p>"Should not I have come?" said Gertrude, incredulously.</p>

<p>"Surely not," said Uncle Fritz, laughing. "I saw your
water-proof in your shawl-strap. I know your mamma
well enough to know that you would never have been
permitted to come so far from home without that &aelig;gis,
or without those trig, pretty overshoes. You owe waterproof
and overshoes both to the steady perseverance of
Goodyear and to the loyal help of his wife and daughters.
Some day you must read Mr. Webster's eulogy on him
and them. Indeed, he is the American Palissy. You
hear a good deal of woman's rights; but, really, modern
women had no rights worth speaking of till Mr. Goodyear
enabled them to go out-doors in all weathers.</p>

<p>"I meant we should have an afternoon with the Goodyears.
Then I meant that you should know, Gertrude,
where that slice of bread came from."</p>

<p>"Well," said she, "I do not know much, but I do
know that. It came out of the bread-box."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very good," said the Colonel, laughing. "But somebody
put it into the bread-box. And it is quite as well
that you should know who put it in. American girls and
American boys ought to know that men's prayer for 'Daily
Bread' is answered more and more largely every year.
They ought to know why. Well, the great reason is that
reaping and binding after the reapers, nay, that sowing
the corn, and every process between sowing and harvest,
has been wellnigh perfected by the American inventors.
So I had wanted to give a day or two to reapers and
binders, and the other machinery of harvesting. Indeed,
if our winter had been as long as poor Captain Greely's
was, and if you had met me every week, we should have
had a new invention for each one. Here are the telephone
and the telegraph. Here is the use of the electric light.
Here is the sewing-machine, with all its nice details, like
the button-hole maker. Nay, every button is made by its
own machinery. Here are carpets one quarter cheaper
than they were only four years ago; cotton cloths made
more by machinery and less by hand labor; nay, they tell
us that the cotton is to be picked by a machine before
long.</p>

<p>"But these are things you must work up for yourselves.
You are on a good track now, and have learned some of
the principles of such study.</p>

<p>"Go to the originals whenever you can. Read what
you understand, and fall back on what you did not understand
at first, so as to try it again."</p>

<p>"Do you not think that all the great things have been
invented, Uncle Fritz?"</p>

<p>This was John Angier's rather melancholy question.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, my boy. Certainly not for as keen
eyes as yours and as handy hands. Let me tell you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
what I heard President Dawson say. He is President of
McGill University, and is counted one of the first physical
philosophers in America.</p>

<p>"He said this in substance: 'What will future times
say of us, the men of the end of the nineteenth century?
They will say, "What was the ban on those men, what
numbed them or held them still, as if in fear? Why did
they not apply in daily life their own great discoveries of
the central laws of Nature? They were able to work out
principles. Why could they not embody them in useful
inventions? They discovered the Ocean of Truth, but
they stood frightened on its shore. They found the
great principles of science, and for their application they
seem to have been satisfied when they had built the
steam-engine, had devised the telegraph, the telephone,
the phonograph, and when they had set the electric light
a blazing."'</p>

<p>"You see, John, that he thinks there is enough more
for you and the rest to invent and to discover."</p>

<p>Then Uncle Fritz took from his ulster pocket Mr.
Parton's volume of biographical sketches.</p>

<p>"It is all very fine for you, Miss Alice," he said, "to
lie there on your waterproof, and to be sure that even
mamma will not scold when you go home. But take the
book, and read, and see who has wept and who has
starved that you might lie there."</p>

<p>And Alice read the passages he had marked for her.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The difficulty of all this may be inferred when we state
that at the present time it takes an intelligent man a year
to learn how to conduct the process with certainty, though
he is provided, from the start, with the best implements
and appliances which twenty years' experience has sug<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>gested.
And poor Goodyear had now reduced himself,
not merely to poverty, but to isolation. No friend of his
could conceal his impatience when he heard him pronounce
the word "India-rubber." Business-men recoiled
from the name of it. He tells us that two entire years
passed, after he had made his discovery, before he had
convinced one human being of its value. Now, too, his
experiments could no longer be carried on with a few
pounds of India-rubber, a quart of turpentine, a phial
of aquafortis, and a little lampblack. He wanted the
means of producing a high, uniform, and controllable degree
of heat,&mdash;a matter of much greater difficulty than
he anticipated. We catch brief glimpses of him at this
time in the volumes of testimony. We see him waiting
for his wife to draw the loaves from her oven, that he
might put into it a batch of India-rubber to bake, and
watching it all the evening, far into the night, to see what
effect was produced by one hour's, two hours', three
hours', six hours' baking. We see him boiling it in his
wife's saucepans, suspending it before the nose of her teakettle,
and hanging it from the handle of that vessel
to within an inch of the boiling water. We see him
roasting it in the ashes and in hot sand, toasting it before
a slow fire and before a quick fire, cooking it for one hour
and for twenty-four hours, changing the proportions of his
compound and mixing them in different ways. No success
rewarded him while he employed only domestic
utensils. Occasionally, it is true, he produced a small
piece of perfectly vulcanized India-rubber; but upon subjecting
other pieces to precisely the same process, they
would blister or char.</p>

<p>Then we see him resorting to the shops and factories
in the neighborhood of Woburn, asking the privilege<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
of using an oven after working hours, or of hanging
a piece of India-rubber in the "man-hole" of the boiler.
The foremen testify that he was a great plague to them,
and smeared their works with his sticky compound; but
though they regarded him as little better than a troublesome
lunatic, they all appear to have helped him very
willingly. He frankly confesses that he lived at this time
on charity; for although <i>he</i> felt confident of being able
to repay the small sums which pity for his family enabled
him to borrow, his neighbors who lent him the money
were as far as possible from expecting payment. Pretending
to lend, they meant to give. One would pay his butcher's
bill or his milk-bill; another would send in a barrel of
flour; another would take in payment some articles of the
old stock of India-rubber; and some of the farmers allowed
his children to gather sticks in their fields to heat his
hillocks of sand containing masses of sulphurized India-rubber.
If the people of New England were not the
most "neighborly" people in the world, his family must
have starved, or he must have given up his experiments.
But, with all the generosity of his neighbors, his children
were often sick, hungry, and cold, without medicine, food,
or fuel. One witness testifies: "I found, in 1839, that
they had not fuel to burn nor food to eat, and did not
know where to get a morsel of food from one day to another,
unless it was sent in to them." We can neither
justify nor condemn their father. Imagine Columbus
within sight of the new world, and his obstinate crew
declaring it was only a mirage, and refusing to row him
ashore. Never was mortal man surer that he had a fortune
in his hand, than Charles Goodyear was when he
would take a piece of scorched and dingy India-rubber
from his pocket and expound its marvellous properties<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
to a group of incredulous villagers. Sure also was he that
he was just upon the point of a practicable success.
Give him but an oven and would he not turn you out fire-proof
and cold-proof India-rubber, as fast as a baker can
produce loaves of bread? Nor was it merely the hope
of deliverance from his pecuniary straits that urged him
on. In all the records of his career, we perceive traces
of something nobler than this. His health being always
infirm, he was haunted with the dread of dying before
he had reached a point in his discoveries where other
men, influenced by ordinary motives, could render them
available.</p>

<p>By the time that he had exhausted the patience of the
foremen of the works near Woburn, he had come to the
conclusion that an oven was the proper means of applying
heat to his compound. An oven he forthwith determined
to build. Having obtained the use of a corner
of a factory yard, his aged father, two of his brothers, his
little son, and himself sallied forth, with pickaxe and
shovels, to begin the work; and when they had done all
that unskilled labor could effect towards it, he induced
a mason to complete it, and paid him in brick-layers'
aprons made of aquafortized India-rubber. This first
oven was a tantalizing failure. The heat was neither
uniform nor controllable. Some of the pieces of India-rubber
would come out so perfectly "cured" as to
demonstrate the utility of his discovery; but others, prepared
in precisely the same manner, as far as he could
discern, were spoiled, either by blistering or charring.
He was puzzled and distressed beyond description; and
no single voice consoled or encouraged him. Out of the
first piece of cloth which he succeeded in vulcanizing he
had a coat made for himself, which was not an ornamental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
garment in its best estate; but, to prove to the unbelievers
that it would stand fire, he brought it so often in contact
with hot stoves, that at last it presented an exceedingly
dingy appearance. His coat did not impress the public
favorably, and it served to confirm the opinion that he was
laboring under a mania.</p>

<p>In the midst of his first disheartening experiments with
sulphur, he had an opportunity of escaping at once from
his troubles. A house in Paris made him an advantageous
offer for the use of his aquafortis process. From the
abyss of his misery the honest man promptly replied, that
that process, valuable as it was, was about to be superseded
by a new method, which he was then perfecting, and as
soon as he had developed it sufficiently he should be glad
to close with their offers. Can we wonder that his neighbors
thought him mad?</p>

<p>It was just after declining the French proposal that he
endured his worst extremity of want and humiliation. It
was in the winter of 1839-40; one of those long and
terrible snowstorms for which New England is noted, had
been raging for many hours, and he awoke one morning
to find his little cottage half buried in snow, the storm
still continuing, and in his house not an atom of fuel nor
a morsel of food. His children were very young, and he
was himself sick and feeble. The charity of his neighbors
was exhausted, and he had not the courage to face their
reproaches. As he looked out of the window upon the
dreary and tumultuous scene,&mdash;"fit emblem of his condition,"
he remarks,&mdash;he called to mind that a few days
before, an acquaintance, a mere acquaintance, who lived
some miles off, had given him upon the road a more
friendly greeting than he was then accustomed to receive.
It had cheered his heart as he trudged sadly by, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
it now returned vividly to his mind. To this gentleman
he determined to apply for relief, if he could reach his
house. Terrible was his struggle with the wind and the
deep drifts. Often he was ready to faint with fatigue,
sickness, and hunger, and he would be obliged to sit
down upon a bank of snow to rest. He reached the
house and told his story, not omitting the oft-told tale
of his new discovery,&mdash;that mine of wealth, if only he
could procure the means of working it. The eager eloquence
of the inventor was seconded by the gaunt and
yellow face of the man. His generous acquaintance entertained
him cordially, and lent him a sum of money,
which not only carried his family through the worst of
the winter, but enabled him to continue his experiments on
a small scale. O. B. Coolidge, of Woburn, was the name
of this benefactor.</p>

<p>On another occasion, when he was in the most urgent
need of materials, he looked about his house to see
if there was left one relic of better days upon which
a little money could be borrowed. There was nothing
but his children's school-books,&mdash;the last things from
which a New Englander is willing to part. There was no
other resource. He gathered them up, and sold them
for five dollars, with which he laid in a fresh stock of gum
and sulphur, and kept on experimenting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alice and Hester looked over the rest of the story
while the others packed up the wrecks of the picnic and
prepared to go down the hill. Then they joined Uncle
Fritz in the advance, and thanked him very seriously for
what he had shown them.</p>

<p>"Such a story as that," said Hester, "is worth more
than anything about cut-offs or valves."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think so too," said he.</p>

<p>"I should like," said the girl, "to write to those children
of his a letter to thank them for what they have
done, and what he did for me, and a million girls like
me."</p>

<p>"It would be a good thing to do," said he, "and
I think I can put you in the way."</p>

<p>"And I do hope," said Alice, eagerly, "that if we are
ever tested in that way we shall bear the test."</p>

<p>"Dear Uncle Fritz, if we cannot invent a flying-machine,
and have not learned how to close up rivets this
winter, we have learned at least how to bear each other's
burdens."</p>

softest and purest wrought iron. [Karsten stated this in these words in
1823.] Cast-iron passes into hard steel in becoming malleable (natural
steel for wire-mills, the 'Wildstahl' of the Germans); and steel, properly
so called, passes into iron, giving in succession mild steel, steel of the
nature of iron, steely iron, and granular iron."</p></div>

<h2><i>EDWARD E. HALE'S WRITINGS.</i></h2>

<p class="blockquot"><b>THE GOOD TIME COMING</b>; or, Our New Crusade.
Square 18mo. Paper, 50 cents; cloth, $1.00.</p>

<p>"It has all the characteristics of its brilliant author,&mdash;unflagging entertainment,
helpfulness, suggestive, practical hints, and a contagious
vitality that sets one's blood tingling. Whoever has read 'Ten Times
One is Ten' will know just what we mean. We predict that the new
volume, as being a more charming story, will have quite as great a parish
of readers. The gist of the book is to show how possible it is for the
best spirits of a community, through wise organization, to form themselves
into a lever by means of which the whole tone of the social status
may be elevated, and the good and highest happiness of the helpless
many be attained through the self-denying exertions of the powerful
few."&mdash;<i>Southern Churchman.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><b>THE INGHAM PAPERS.</b> 16mo. $1.25.</p>

<p>"But it is not alone for their wit and ingenuity we prize Mr. Hale's
stories, but for the serious thought, the moral, or practical suggestion
underlying all of them. They are not written simply to amuse, but have
a graver purpose. Of the stories in the present volume, the best to out
thinking is 'The Rag Man and Rag Woman.'"&mdash;<i>Boston Transcript.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><b>HOW TO DO IT.</b> 16mo. $1.00.</p>

<p>"Good sense, very practical suggestions, telling illustrations (in words),
lively fancy, and delightful humor combine to make Mr. Hale's hints
exceedingly taking and stimulating, and we do not see how either sex
can fail, after reading his pages, to know How to Talk, How to Write,
How to Read, How to go into Society, and How to Travel. These, with
Life at School, Life in Vacation, Life Alone, Habits in Church, Life
with Children, Life with your Elders, Habits of Reading, and Getting
Ready, are the several topics of the more than as many chapters, and
make the volume one which should find its way to the hands of every
boy and girl. To this end we would like to see it in every Sabbath-school
library in the land."&mdash;<i>Congregationalist.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><b>CRUSOE IN NEW YORK</b>, and other Stories. 16mo.
$1.00.</p>

<p>"If one desires something unique, full of wit, a veiled sarcasm that
is rich in the extreme, it will all be found in this charming little book.
The air of perfect sincerity with which they are told, the diction, reminding
one of 'The Vicar of Wakefield,' and the ludicrous improbability
of the tales, give them a power rarely met with in 'short stories.'
There is many a lesson to be learned from the quiet little volume."</p>


<p class="blockquot"><b>THE MAN WITHOUT A COUNTRY</b>, and other
Tales. 16mo. $1.25.</p>

<p>"A collection of those strange, amusing, and fascinating stories, which,
in their simplicity of narrative, minute detail, allusion to passing occurrences,
and thorough <i>naturalness</i>, make us almost feel that the difference
between truth and fiction is not worth mentioning. Mr. Hale is the
prince of story-tellers; and the marvel is that his practical brain can have
such a vein of frolicsome fancy and quaint humor running through it. It
will pay any one to <i>think</i> while reading these."&mdash;<i>Universalist Quarterly.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><b>WORKINGMEN'S HOMES.</b> Illustrated. 16mo. $1.00.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hale has a concern, as the Friends say, that laboring men should
have better homes than they usually find in the great cities. He believes
all the great charities of the cities fail to overtake their task, because the
working men are always slipping down to lower degrees of discomfort,
unhealthiness, and vice by the depressing influences surrounding their
homes. He writes racily and earnestly, and with rare literary excellence."&mdash;<i>Presbyterian.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><b>TEN TIMES ONE IS TEN</b>: The Possible Reformation.
A new edition, in two parts. Part I. The Story. Part
II. Harry Wadsworth and Wadsworth Clubs. 16mo. $1.00.</p>

<p class="center">HARRY WADSWORTH'S MOTTO.</p>

<p class="poem">
"To look up and not down;<br />
To look forward and not back;<br />
To look out and not in; and<br />
To lend a hand.<br />
</p>

<p>"The four rules are over my writing-desk and in my heart. Every
school boy and girl of age to understand it should have this story, and, if
I was rich enough, should have it."&mdash;<i>Extract from a letter by an unknown
correspondent.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><b>MRS. MERRIAM'S SCHOLARS.</b> A Story of the
"Original Ten." 16mo. $1.00.</p>

<p>"It is almost inevitable that such a book as 'Ten Times One is Ten'
should suggest others in the same line of thought; and Mr. Hale begins
in 'Mrs. Merriam's Scholars' to take up a few of what he terms the
'dropped stitches' of the narrative. The story is exceedingly simple, so
far as concerns its essentials, and carries the reader forward with an interest
in its motive which Mr. Hale seldom fails to impart to his writings....
The two already published should be in every Sunday-school library,
and, indeed, wherever they will be likely to fall into the hands of appreciative
readers."</p>


<p class="blockquot"><b>HIS LEVEL BEST.</b> 16mo. $1.25.</p>

<p>"We like Mr. Hale's style. He is fresh, frank, pungent, straightforward,
and pointed. The first story is the one that gives the book its
title, and it is related in a dignified manner, showing peculiar genius and
humorous talent. The contents are, 'His Level Best,' 'The Brick
Moon,' 'Water Talk,' 'Mouse and Lion,' 'The Modern Sinbad,'
'A Tale of a Salamander.'"&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Exchange.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><b>GONE TO TEXAS</b>; or, The Wonderful Adventures of a
Pullman. 16mo. $1.00.</p>

<p>"There are few books of travel which combine in a romance of true love
so many touches of the real life of many people, in glimpses of happy
homes, in pictures of scenery and sunset, as the beautiful panorama unrolled
before us from the windows of this Pullman car. The book is
crisp and bright, and has a pleasant flavor; and whatever is lovely in the
spirit of its author, or of good report in his name, one may look here and
find promise of both fulfilled."&mdash;<i>Exchange.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><b>WHAT CAREER?</b> or, The Choice of a Vocation and the
Use of Time. 16mo. $1.25.</p>

<p>"'What Career?' is a book which will do anybody good to read; especially
is it a profitable book for young men to 'read, mark, and inwardly
digest.' Mr. Hale seems to know what young men need, and
here he gives them the result of his large experience and careful observation.
A list of the subjects treated in this little volume will sufficiently
indicate its scope: (1) The Leaders Lead; (2) The Specialties; (3) Noblesse
Oblige; (4) The Mind's Maximum; (5) A Theological Seminary;
(6) Character; (7) Responsibilities of Young Men; (8) Study Outside
School; (9) The Training of Men; (10) Exercise."&mdash;<i>Watchman.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><b>UPS AND DOWNS.</b> An Every-Day Novel. 16mo.
$1.50.</p>

<p>"This book is certainly very enjoyable. It delineates American life so
graphically that we feel as if Mr. Hale must have seen every rood of
ground he describes, and must have known personally every character
he so cleverly depicts. In his hearty fellowship with young people lies
his great power. The story is permeated with a spirit of glad-heartedness
and elasticity which in this hurried, anxious, money-making age it is most
refreshing to meet with in any one out of his teens; and the author's sympathy
with, and respect for, the little romances of his young friends is
most fraternal."&mdash;<i>New Church Magazine.</i></p>


<p class="blockquot"><b>SEVEN SPANISH CITIES</b>, and the Way to Them.
16mo. $1.25.</p>

<p>"The Rev. E. E. Hale's 'Spanish Cities' is in the author's most
lively style, full of fun, with touches of romance, glimpses of history, allusions
to Oriental literature, earnest talk about religion, consideration of
Spanish politics, and a rapid, running description of everything that
observant eyes could possibly see. Mr. Hale makes Spain more attractive
and more amusing than any other traveller has done, and he lavishes
upon her epigram and wit."&mdash;<i>Boston Advertiser.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><b>CHRISTMAS EVE AND CHRISTMAS DAY.</b>
Ten Stories. 16mo. $1.25.</p>

<p>"Many an eye has moistened, and many a heart grown kindlier with
Christmas thoughts over 'Daily Bread,' and some of the lesser stars
which now shine in the same galaxy; and the volume which contains
them will carry on their humane ministry to many a future Christmas
time."&mdash;<i>Christian Register.</i></p>

<p class="blockquot"><b>IN HIS NAME.</b> A Story of the Waldenses, Seven Hundred
Years ago. Square 18mo. Paper, 30 cents; cloth, $1.00.</p>

<p>"A touching, almost a thrilling, tale is this by E. E. Hale, in its pathetic
simplicity and its deep meaning. It is a story of the Waldenses
in the days when Richard C&#339;ur de Lion and his splendid following
wended their way to the Crusades, and when the name of Christ inspired
men who dwelt in palaces, and men who sheltered themselves in
the forests of France. 'In his Name' was the 'Open Sesame' to the
hearts of such as these, and it is to illustrate the power of this almost
magical phrase that the story is written. That it is charmingly written,
follows from its authorship. There is in fact no little book that we have
seen of late that offers so much of so pleasant reading in such little space,
and conveys so apt and pertinent a lesson of pure religion."&mdash;<i>N. Y.
Commercial Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>"The very loveliest Christmas story ever written. It has the ring of an
old Troubadour in it."</p>

<p class="blockquot"><b>A SUMMER VACATION.</b> 16mo. 50 cents.</p>

<p>"After Mr. Hale's return from Europe he preached to his people four
sermons concerning his European experience. At the request of 'some
who heard them,' Mr. Hale has allowed these sermons to be published
with this title. They are full of vigorous thought, wide philanthropy,
and practical suggestions, and will be read with interest by all classes."&mdash;<i>Boston
Transcript.</i></p>
